Module 1: Early Assessment
This module identifies best practices for the early assessment of suspected stroke. Patients typically
present at the ED, but the same practices should be followed at an outpatient clinic or when patients
are directly admitted to acute care. The recommendations emphasize assessing the patient to inform
clinical decision-making and determine the most appropriate pathway.
Module 1 Recommended Practices 
1.1 Initial evaluation
1.1.1 Rapid initial evaluation should be conducted for airway,
breathing, and circulation
1.2 Initial examinations
1.2.1 All patients should undergo a neurological examination to
determine focal neurological deficits and assess stroke severity on a
standardized stroke scale (NIHSS or CNS for stroke)
1.2.2 Patients presenting with potentially disabling, acute neurological
symptoms suggestive of an acute stroke within 6.0 hours of symptom
onset, and may be considered for those in whom treatment can be
initiated within a 12- hour window from stroke symptom onset, who
meet clinical and imaging criteria may be considered for endovascular
therapy
1.2.3 All patients with suspected acute stroke (presenting within acute
stroke treatment time window) should undergo rapid brain imaging
(non-contrast CT or MRI) and CTA (Door to CT/CTA should be less
than twenty five minutes)
1.2.4. For patients with acute ischemic stroke that are clinically eligible
for acute stroke treatments, advanced CT imaging including CT and
multiphase CTA or Perfusion CT should be considered.
1.2.5 Brain imaging should be interpreted immediately by a health care
provider with expertise in reading/interpreting CT/CTA and/or MRI of
the brain
1.2.6 All patients should undergo ECG to detect atrial fibrillation and
other acute arrhythmias but should not delay acute treatment
1.2.7 A chest x-ray should not delay assessment for thrombolysis 
1.2.8 All patients should have the following blood work:
• CBC
• electrolytes
• creatinine
• glucose
• INR
• partial thromboplastin time
• troponin test (if clinically indicated)
1.3 Assessment and early management of dysphagia
1.3.1 All patients with stroke should be made NPO initially and have
their swallowing ability screened using a simple, valid, reliable, bedside
testing protocol as part of their initial assessment and before initiating
oral medication, fluid, or food
1.3.2 All patients with stroke who are not alert within the first 24 hours
should be monitored closely, and swallowing ability should be
screened when clinically appropriate
1.3.3 Patients with stroke presenting with features indicating dysphagia
or pulmonary aspiration should receive a full clinical assessment of
their swallowing ability by a speech-language pathologist or
appropriately trained specialist who would advise on swallowing ability
and the required consistency of diet and fluids
1.4 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
1.4.1 All patients, whether admitted to hospital or discharged from the
ED, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
1.5 Recommendation is not applicable to ischemic or ICH stroke patients
1.6 Initial examinations for ischemic stroke
1.6.1 Recommendation is not applicable to ischemic stroke patients
1.6.2 All other patients (presenting beyond 48 hours) with a TIA or
ischemic stroke should undergo vascular imaging of the brain and
neck arteries as soon as possible
1.7 Initial examinations for ICH
1.7.1 Patients with ICH must be treated as a medical emergency. ICH
should be promptly recognized, and patients should be evaluated
immediately by physicians with expertise in stroke management
1.7.2 Evaluation of patients with acute ICH should include questions
about anticoagulant therapy, measurement of platelet count, PTT, and
INR
1.7.3 Select patients with ICH should have CTA or MRA as soon as
possible

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 1 Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• Development and/or updating of ED acute stroke protocols to ensure communication with CritiCall Ontario as soon as
possible to determine treatment and transport decisions for patients presenting with potentially disabling, acute
neurological symptoms suggestive of an acute stroke within 6.0 hours of symptom onset and considered to be a
potential candidate for intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular therapy (EVT)
• Regional planning for access to acute stroke EVT should consider the following:
o The importance of rapid triage, assessment and brain imaging (including parallel vascular imaging) of acute
stroke patients who are potential candidates for EVT.
o Development of regional and provincial bypass and repatriation agreements
o Sites should establish rapid communication protocols with closest EVT site(s), facilitated through CritiCall
Ontario.
o Development of regional protocols to support a “drip and ship” process.
• Capacity Planning is needed to develop access to EVT for patients living within regions where currently there is a
greater than two (2) hour patient transfer time to an EVT Centre
• Where feasible, development of processes and protocols to facilitate EMS to divert patients to regional or district
stroke and /Endovascular Treatment centres if there is suspicion of stroke
• The process for EMS prenotification of the receiving stroke hospital about a stroke patient arrival should be better
established to ensure acute stroke teams receive timely and detailed information
• Collaboration between local EMS and institutions that provide stroke services should occur in all stroke networks
across the province to support quality improvement initiatives that facilitate access to stroke care
• Ongoing education should be provided to EMS crews about the recognition of stroke symptoms and regional medical
redirect protocols, including time sensitive treatments such as thrombolysis,EVT, patient transport monitoring and
management.
• Upon receiving EMS prenotification, the receiving hospital’s acute stroke team should be contacted and called to the
ED (for appropriate patients)
• Standardized stroke assessment and treatment protocols/tools should be developed and used in all Ontario hospital
EDs
• Access should be increased in all hospitals to either stroke physician experts or radiologists who can interpret brain
imaging urgently and allow for full assessment and treatment with tPA thrombolysis within target door to needle time
of less than 60 minutes in 90% of treated patients and a median door to needle time of 30 mins. of patient arrival for
appropriate patients
• Sufficient human resources capacity should be ensured so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely
manner
• To facilitate early assessment, hospital-level CTAS I or CTAS II access to diagnostic imaging should be established
for suspected stroke patients
• Rapid turnaround times for lab work should be negotiated in hospitals that provide tPA thrombolysis for ischemic
stroke patients to facilitate rapid assessment and treatment
• Efforts to raise public awareness about the symptoms of stroke and when to contact 911 should continue to be
enhanced and funded
• Capacity planning to ensure access to CT/CTA should include:
o Training for CT technologists
o Adoption of provincial CT/CTA Protocol
o Human resource availability
o Communication processes with EVT Centre experts
