**task_prompt**: Module 1: Early Assessment
This module identifies best practices for the early assessment of suspected TIA or minor
(nondisabling) stroke. Patients typically present at the ED, but the same practices should be followed
at an outpatient clinic or when patients are directly admitted to acute care. The recommendations
emphasize assessing the patient to inform clinical decision-making and determine the most
appropriate pathway.
Module 1 Recommended Practices 
1.1 Initial evaluation
1.1.1 Rapid initial evaluation should be conducted for airway,
breathing, and circulation
1.2 Initial examinations
1.2.1 All patients should undergo a neurological examination to
determine focal neurological deficits and assess stroke severity on a
standardized stroke scale (NIHSS or CNS for stroke)
1.2.2 All patients should undergo brain imaging (CT or MRI)
immediately
1.2.3 Brain imaging should be interpreted immediately by a health care
provider with expertise in reading CT and/or MRI
1.2.4 All patients should undergo ECG to detect atrial fibrillation and
other acute arrhythmias
1.2.5 A chest x-ray should not delay assessment for thrombolysis 
1.2.6 All patients should have the following blood work:
• CBC
• electrolytes
• creatinine
• glucose
• INR
• partial thromboplastin time
• troponin test (if clinically indicated)
1.3 Assessment and early management of dysphagia
1.3.1 All patients with stroke should be made NPO initially and have
their swallowing ability screened using a simple, valid, reliable, bedside
testing protocol as part of their initial assessment and before initiating
oral medication, fluid, or food
1.3.2 All patients with stroke who are not alert within the first 24 hours
should be monitored closely, and swallowing ability should be
screened when clinically appropriate
1.3.3 Patients with stroke presenting with features indicating dysphagia
or pulmonary aspiration should receive a full clinical assessment of
their swallowing ability by a speech-language pathologist or
appropriately trained specialist who would advise on swallowing ability
and the required consistency of diet and fluids
1.4 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
1.4.1 All patients, whether admitted to hospital or discharged from the
ED, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
1.5 Triage tool for patients with TIA
1.5.1 A standardized triage tool should be used to determine the
appropriate location for the care of patients with TIA
1.6 Initial examinations for TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
1.6.1 Patients with a TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke presenting
within 48 hours of symptom onset or with fluctuating motor or speech
symptoms should undergo immediate vascular imaging of the neck
arteries (carotid ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) unless the patient is clearly
not a candidate for carotid artery revascularization
1.6.2 All other patients (presenting beyond 48 hours) with a TIA or
ischemic stroke should undergo vascular imaging of the brain and
neck arteries as soon as possible
1.7 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 1 Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• Where feasible, EMS should divert patients to regional or district stroke centres if there is suspicion of stroke/TIA
• The process for EMS prenotification of the receiving hospital about a stroke/TIA patient arrival should be better
established to ensure acute stroke teams receive timely and detailed information
• Collaboration between local EMS and institutions that provide stroke services should occur in all stroke networks across
the province to support quality improvement and facilitate access to stroke care
• Ongoing education should be provided to EMS crews about the recognition of stroke/TIA symptoms and regional
medical redirect protocols
• Standardized stroke/TIA assessment and treatment protocols/tools should be developed and used in all Ontario hospital
EDs
• Upon receiving EMS prenotification, the receiving hospital’s acute stroke team should be contacted and called to the ED
(for appropriate patients)
• Sufficient human resources capacity should be ensured so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely
manner
• To facilitate early assessment, hospital-level CTAS I or CTAS II access to diagnostic imaging should be established for
suspected stroke/TIA patients to facilitate early assessment
• A referral process for rapid-assessment TIA and minor stroke units/TIA clinics and provincial stroke-prevention clinics
should be established in all hospitals for patients who are not admitted to hospital
• Efforts to raise public awareness about the symptoms of stroke/TIA and when to contact 911 should continue to be
enhanced and funded

at an outpatient clinic or when patients are directly admitted to acute care. The recommendations
emphasize assessing the patient to inform clinical decision-making and determine the most
appropriate pathway.
Module 1 Recommended Practices 
1.1 Initial evaluation
1.1.1 Rapid initial evaluation should be conducted for airway,
breathing, and circulation
1.2 Initial examinations
1.2.1 All patients should undergo a neurological examination to
determine focal neurological deficits and assess stroke severity on a
standardized stroke scale (NIHSS or CNS for stroke)
1.2.2 All patients should undergo brain imaging (CT or MRI)
immediately
1.2.3 Brain imaging should be interpreted immediately by a health care
provider with expertise in reading CT and/or MRI
1.2.4 All patients should undergo ECG to detect atrial fibrillation and
other acute arrhythmias
1.2.5 A chest x-ray should not delay assessment for thrombolysis 
1.2.6 All patients should have the following blood work:
• CBC
• electrolytes
• creatinine
• glucose
• INR
• partial thromboplastin time
• troponin test (if clinically indicated)
1.3 Assessment and early management of dysphagia
1.3.1 All patients with stroke should be made NPO initially and have
their swallowing ability screened using a simple, valid, reliable, bedside
testing protocol as part of their initial assessment and before initiating
oral medication, fluid, or food
1.3.2 All patients with stroke who are not alert within the first 24 hours
should be monitored closely, and swallowing ability should be
screened when clinically appropriate
1.3.3 Patients with stroke presenting with features indicating dysphagia
or pulmonary aspiration should receive a full clinical assessment of
their swallowing ability by a speech-language pathologist or
appropriately trained specialist who would advise on swallowing ability
and the required consistency of diet and fluids
1.4 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
1.4.1 All patients, whether admitted to hospital or discharged from the
ED, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
1.5 Triage tool for patients with TIA
1.5.1 A standardized triage tool should be used to determine the
appropriate location for the care of patients with TIA
1.6 Initial examinations for TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
1.6.1 Patients with a TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke presenting
within 48 hours of symptom onset or with fluctuating motor or speech
symptoms should undergo immediate vascular imaging of the neck
arteries (carotid ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) unless the patient is clearly
not a candidate for carotid artery revascularization
1.6.2 All other patients (presenting beyond 48 hours) with a TIA or
ischemic stroke should undergo vascular imaging of the brain and
neck arteries as soon as possible
1.7 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 1 Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• Where feasible, EMS should divert patients to regional or district stroke centres if there is suspicion of stroke/TIA
• The process for EMS prenotification of the receiving hospital about a stroke/TIA patient arrival should be better
established to ensure acute stroke teams receive timely and detailed information
• Collaboration between local EMS and institutions that provide stroke services should occur in all stroke networks across
the province to support quality improvement and facilitate access to stroke care
• Ongoing education should be provided to EMS crews about the recognition of stroke/TIA symptoms and regional
medical redirect protocols
• Standardized stroke/TIA assessment and treatment protocols/tools should be developed and used in all Ontario hospital
EDs
• Upon receiving EMS prenotification, the receiving hospital’s acute stroke team should be contacted and called to the ED
(for appropriate patients)
• Sufficient human resources capacity should be ensured so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely
manner
• To facilitate early assessment, hospital-level CTAS I or CTAS II access to diagnostic imaging should be established for
suspected stroke/TIA patients to facilitate early assessment
• A referral process for rapid-assessment TIA and minor stroke units/TIA clinics and provincial stroke-prevention clinics
should be established in all hospitals for patients who are not admitted to hospital
• Efforts to raise public awareness about the symptoms of stroke/TIA and when to contact 911 should continue to be
enhanced and funded

Please design a process according to the task and output it in the following format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

You must follow the bellow notes:
Note 1: You must include all tasks mentioned in the QBP's recommended practices section, regardless of perceived importance.
Note 2: Retain important information such as timeframe and frequency details within activity labels.
Note 3: As these are clinical pathways, use concurrency when there is no obvious sequence between activities.

their swallowing ability screened using a simple, valid, reliable, bedside
testing protocol as part of their initial assessment and before initiating
oral medication, fluid, or food
1.3.2 All patients with stroke who are not alert within the first 24 hours
should be monitored closely, and swallowing ability should be
screened when clinically appropriate
1.3.3 Patients with stroke presenting with features indicating dysphagia
or pulmonary aspiration should receive a full clinical assessment of
their swallowing ability by a speech-language pathologist or
appropriately trained specialist who would advise on swallowing ability
and the required consistency of diet and fluids

Please design a process according to the task and output it in the following format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

Here are some examples of process text, and you can refer to these process texts but cannot copy them:

**task_prompt**: Module 1: Early Assessment
This module identifies best practices for the early assessment of suspected TIA or minor
(nondisabling) stroke. Patients typically present at the ED, but the same practices should be followed
at an outpatient clinic or when patients are directly admitted to acute care. The recommendations
emphasize assessing the patient to inform clinical decision-making and determine the most
appropriate pathway.
Module 1 Recommended Practices 
1.1 Initial evaluation
1.1.1 Rapid initial evaluation should be conducted for airway,
breathing, and circulation
1.2 Initial examinations
1.2.1 All patients should undergo a neurological examination to
determine focal neurological deficits and assess stroke severity on a
standardized stroke scale (NIHSS or CNS for stroke)
1.2.2 All patients should undergo brain imaging (CT or MRI)
immediately
1.2.3 Brain imaging should be interpreted immediately by a health care
provider with expertise in reading CT and/or MRI
1.2.4 All patients should undergo ECG to detect atrial fibrillation and
other acute arrhythmias
1.2.5 A chest x-ray should not delay assessment for thrombolysis 
1.2.6 All patients should have the following blood work:
• CBC
• electrolytes
• creatinine
• glucose
• INR
• partial thromboplastin time
• troponin test (if clinically indicated)
1.3 Assessment and early management of dysphagia
1.3.1 All patients with stroke should be made NPO initially and have
their swallowing ability screened using a simple, valid, reliable, bedside
testing protocol as part of their initial assessment and before initiating
oral medication, fluid, or food
1.3.2 All patients with stroke who are not alert within the first 24 hours
should be monitored closely, and swallowing ability should be
screened when clinically appropriate
1.3.3 Patients with stroke presenting with features indicating dysphagia
or pulmonary aspiration should receive a full clinical assessment of
their swallowing ability by a speech-language pathologist or
appropriately trained specialist who would advise on swallowing ability
and the required consistency of diet and fluids
1.4 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
1.4.1 All patients, whether admitted to hospital or discharged from the
ED, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
1.5 Triage tool for patients with TIA
1.5.1 A standardized triage tool should be used to determine the
appropriate location for the care of patients with TIA
1.6 Initial examinations for TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
1.6.1 Patients with a TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke presenting
within 48 hours of symptom onset or with fluctuating motor or speech
symptoms should undergo immediate vascular imaging of the neck
arteries (carotid ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) unless the patient is clearly
not a candidate for carotid artery revascularization
1.6.2 All other patients (presenting beyond 48 hours) with a TIA or
ischemic stroke should undergo vascular imaging of the brain and
neck arteries as soon as possible
1.7 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 1 Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• Where feasible, EMS should divert patients to regional or district stroke centres if there is suspicion of stroke/TIA
• The process for EMS prenotification of the receiving hospital about a stroke/TIA patient arrival should be better
established to ensure acute stroke teams receive timely and detailed information
• Collaboration between local EMS and institutions that provide stroke services should occur in all stroke networks across
the province to support quality improvement and facilitate access to stroke care
• Ongoing education should be provided to EMS crews about the recognition of stroke/TIA symptoms and regional
medical redirect protocols
• Standardized stroke/TIA assessment and treatment protocols/tools should be developed and used in all Ontario hospital
EDs
• Upon receiving EMS prenotification, the receiving hospital’s acute stroke team should be contacted and called to the ED
(for appropriate patients)
• Sufficient human resources capacity should be ensured so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely
manner
• To facilitate early assessment, hospital-level CTAS I or CTAS II access to diagnostic imaging should be established for
suspected stroke/TIA patients to facilitate early assessment
• A referral process for rapid-assessment TIA and minor stroke units/TIA clinics and provincial stroke-prevention clinics
should be established in all hospitals for patients who are not admitted to hospital
• Efforts to raise public awareness about the symptoms of stroke/TIA and when to contact 911 should continue to be
enhanced and funded

Here is a new customer's task: Module 1: Early Assessment
This module identifies best practices for the early assessment of suspected TIA or minor
(nondisabling) stroke. Patients typically present at the ED, but the same practices should be followed
at an outpatient clinic or when patients are directly admitted to acute care. The recommendations
emphasize assessing the patient to inform clinical decision-making and determine the most
appropriate pathway.
Module 1 Recommended Practices 
1.1 Initial evaluation
1.1.1 Rapid initial evaluation should be conducted for airway,
breathing, and circulation
1.2 Initial examinations
1.2.1 All patients should undergo a neurological examination to
determine focal neurological deficits and assess stroke severity on a
standardized stroke scale (NIHSS or CNS for stroke)
1.2.2 All patients should undergo brain imaging (CT or MRI)
immediately
1.2.3 Brain imaging should be interpreted immediately by a health care
provider with expertise in reading CT and/or MRI
1.2.4 All patients should undergo ECG to detect atrial fibrillation and
other acute arrhythmias
1.2.5 A chest x-ray should not delay assessment for thrombolysis 
1.2.6 All patients should have the following blood work:
• CBC
• electrolytes
• creatinine
• glucose
• INR
• partial thromboplastin time
• troponin test (if clinically indicated)
1.3 Assessment and early management of dysphagia
1.3.1 All patients with stroke should be made NPO initially and have
their swallowing ability screened using a simple, valid, reliable, bedside
testing protocol as part of their initial assessment and before initiating
oral medication, fluid, or food
1.3.2 All patients with stroke who are not alert within the first 24 hours
should be monitored closely, and swallowing ability should be
screened when clinically appropriate
1.3.3 Patients with stroke presenting with features indicating dysphagia
or pulmonary aspiration should receive a full clinical assessment of
their swallowing ability by a speech-language pathologist or
appropriately trained specialist who would advise on swallowing ability
and the required consistency of diet and fluids
1.4 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
1.4.1 All patients, whether admitted to hospital or discharged from the
ED, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
1.5 Triage tool for patients with TIA
1.5.1 A standardized triage tool should be used to determine the
appropriate location for the care of patients with TIA
1.6 Initial examinations for TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
1.6.1 Patients with a TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke presenting
within 48 hours of symptom onset or with fluctuating motor or speech
symptoms should undergo immediate vascular imaging of the neck
arteries (carotid ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) unless the patient is clearly
not a candidate for carotid artery revascularization
1.6.2 All other patients (presenting beyond 48 hours) with a TIA or
ischemic stroke should undergo vascular imaging of the brain and
neck arteries as soon as possible
1.7 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 1 Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• Where feasible, EMS should divert patients to regional or district stroke centres if there is suspicion of stroke/TIA
• The process for EMS prenotification of the receiving hospital about a stroke/TIA patient arrival should be better
established to ensure acute stroke teams receive timely and detailed information
• Collaboration between local EMS and institutions that provide stroke services should occur in all stroke networks across
the province to support quality improvement and facilitate access to stroke care
• Ongoing education should be provided to EMS crews about the recognition of stroke/TIA symptoms and regional
medical redirect protocols
• Standardized stroke/TIA assessment and treatment protocols/tools should be developed and used in all Ontario hospital
EDs
• Upon receiving EMS prenotification, the receiving hospital’s acute stroke team should be contacted and called to the ED
(for appropriate patients)
• Sufficient human resources capacity should be ensured so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely
manner
• To facilitate early assessment, hospital-level CTAS I or CTAS II access to diagnostic imaging should be established for
suspected stroke/TIA patients to facilitate early assessment
• A referral process for rapid-assessment TIA and minor stroke units/TIA clinics and provincial stroke-prevention clinics
should be established in all hospitals for patients who are not admitted to hospital
• Efforts to raise public awareness about the symptoms of stroke/TIA and when to contact 911 should continue to be
enhanced and funded

Please design a process according to the task and output it in the following format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

You must follow the bellow notes:
Note 1: You must include all tasks mentioned in the QBP's recommended practices section, regardless of perceived importance.
Note 2: Retain important information such as timeframe and frequency details within activity labels.
Note 3: As these are clinical pathways, use concurrency when there is no obvious sequence between activities.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 1: Early Assessment
This module identifies best practices for the early assessment of suspected TIA or minor
(nondisabling) stroke. Patients typically present at the ED, but the same practices should be followed
at an outpatient clinic or when patients are directly admitted to acute care. The recommendations
emphasize assessing the patient to inform clinical decision-making and determine the most
appropriate pathway.
Module 1 Recommended Practices 
1.1 Initial evaluation
1.1.1 Rapid initial evaluation should be conducted for airway,
breathing, and circulation
1.2 Initial examinations
1.2.1 All patients should undergo a neurological examination to
determine focal neurological deficits and assess stroke severity on a
standardized stroke scale (NIHSS or CNS for stroke)
1.2.2 All patients should undergo brain imaging (CT or MRI)
immediately
1.2.3 Brain imaging should be interpreted immediately by a health care
provider with expertise in reading CT and/or MRI
1.2.4 All patients should undergo ECG to detect atrial fibrillation and
other acute arrhythmias
1.2.5 A chest x-ray should not delay assessment for thrombolysis 
1.2.6 All patients should have the following blood work:
• CBC
• electrolytes
• creatinine
• glucose
• INR
• partial thromboplastin time
• troponin test (if clinically indicated)
1.3 Assessment and early management of dysphagia
1.3.1 All patients with stroke should be made NPO initially and have
their swallowing ability screened using a simple, valid, reliable, bedside
testing protocol as part of their initial assessment and before initiating
oral medication, fluid, or food
1.3.2 All patients with stroke who are not alert within the first 24 hours
should be monitored closely, and swallowing ability should be
screened when clinically appropriate
1.3.3 Patients with stroke presenting with features indicating dysphagia
or pulmonary aspiration should receive a full clinical assessment of
their swallowing ability by a speech-language pathologist or
appropriately trained specialist who would advise on swallowing ability
and the required consistency of diet and fluids
1.4 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
1.4.1 All patients, whether admitted to hospital or discharged from the
ED, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
1.5 Triage tool for patients with TIA
1.5.1 A standardized triage tool should be used to determine the
appropriate location for the care of patients with TIA
1.6 Initial examinations for TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
1.6.1 Patients with a TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke presenting
within 48 hours of symptom onset or with fluctuating motor or speech
symptoms should undergo immediate vascular imaging of the neck
arteries (carotid ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) unless the patient is clearly
not a candidate for carotid artery revascularization
1.6.2 All other patients (presenting beyond 48 hours) with a TIA or
ischemic stroke should undergo vascular imaging of the brain and
neck arteries as soon as possible
1.7 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke
Management; CBC, complete blood count; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; CNS, Canadian Neurological Scale; CT,
computed tomography; CTA, computed tomography angiography; ECG, electrocardiogram; ED, emergency department; INR, international
normalized ratio; MRA, magnetic resonance angiography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; NHS/NICE, National Collaborating Centre for
Chronic Conditions; NIHSS, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale; NPO, nil per os (nothing by mouth); SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate
Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 1 Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• Where feasible, EMS should divert patients to regional or district stroke centres if there is suspicion of stroke/TIA
• The process for EMS prenotification of the receiving hospital about a stroke/TIA patient arrival should be better
established to ensure acute stroke teams receive timely and detailed information
• Collaboration between local EMS and institutions that provide stroke services should occur in all stroke networks across
the province to support quality improvement and facilitate access to stroke care
• Ongoing education should be provided to EMS crews about the recognition of stroke/TIA symptoms and regional
medical redirect protocols
• Standardized stroke/TIA assessment and treatment protocols/tools should be developed and used in all Ontario hospital
EDs
• Upon receiving EMS prenotification, the receiving hospital’s acute stroke team should be contacted and called to the ED
(for appropriate patients)
• Sufficient human resources capacity should be ensured so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely
manner
• To facilitate early assessment, hospital-level CTAS I or CTAS II access to diagnostic imaging should be established for
suspected stroke/TIA patients to facilitate early assessment
• A referral process for rapid-assessment TIA and minor stroke units/TIA clinics and provincial stroke-prevention clinics
should be established in all hospitals for patients who are not admitted to hospital
• Efforts to raise public awareness about the symptoms of stroke/TIA and when to contact 911 should continue to be
enhanced and funded
Abbreviations: CTAS, Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale; ED, emergency department; EMS, emergency medical services; TIA, transient
ischemic attack..

| **phase_prompt** | task: {task} process text: {refinement_process_text} Check which activities in the process text can be expanded into sub-activities and add these sub-activities to the process text. Please note: 1) Only expand important activities, not all of them. 2) Ensure that the process text remains logical when adding sub-activities. 3) Add appropriate gateways when adding activities. 4) When modifying the process text, note whether the newly added activity is a sequential, exclusive, or concurrent relationship. 5) Only expand activities if it's necessary and do not create overly detailed sub-activities. Here are some examples of expanding activities in process texts into sub-activities. You can refer to them but cannot copy them: 1. 'payment with card/cash' activity with id='activity2' can be expanded to:    sub-activity:'Payment with card' and 'Payment with cash'     activity relations: exclusive 2. 'club interviewid and confimation email' activity with id='activity5' can be expanded to:    sub-activity:'Interview at the club' and 'Send confirmation email'    activity relations: sequential 3. 'Submit the materials' activity with id='activity9' can be expanded to:    sub-activity:'Submit interview materials' and 'Submit examination materials'     activity relations: parallel After extending the activity, number the activity or gateway in addition to the original id. If the sub-activity are exclusive or parallel relationships, you need to add them in the form of gateways when modifying the process text: {format} First output which activities can be extended according to the above format (...... can be expanded to:.......) and then give the modified process text.

[You're a process design expert. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include process generation, process refinement, process review and so on, guided by team leader.
You model the process of a clinical practice guideline to a clinical pathway.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 1: Early Assessment
This module identifies best practices for the early assessment of suspected TIA or minor
(nondisabling) stroke. Patients typically present at the ED, but the same practices should be followed
at an outpatient clinic or when patients are directly admitted to acute care. The recommendations
emphasize assessing the patient to inform clinical decision-making and determine the most
appropriate pathway.
Module 1 Recommended Practices 
1.1 Initial evaluation
1.1.1 Rapid initial evaluation should be conducted for airway,
breathing, and circulation
1.2 Initial examinations
1.2.1 All patients should undergo a neurological examination to
determine focal neurological deficits and assess stroke severity on a
standardized stroke scale (NIHSS or CNS for stroke)
1.2.2 All patients should undergo brain imaging (CT or MRI)
immediately
1.2.3 Brain imaging should be interpreted immediately by a health care
provider with expertise in reading CT and/or MRI
1.2.4 All patients should undergo ECG to detect atrial fibrillation and
other acute arrhythmias
1.2.5 A chest x-ray should not delay assessment for thrombolysis 
1.2.6 All patients should have the following blood work:
• CBC
• electrolytes
• creatinine
• glucose
• INR
• partial thromboplastin time
• troponin test (if clinically indicated)
1.3 Assessment and early management of dysphagia
1.3.1 All patients with stroke should be made NPO initially and have
their swallowing ability screened using a simple, valid, reliable, bedside
testing protocol as part of their initial assessment and before initiating
oral medication, fluid, or food
1.3.2 All patients with stroke who are not alert within the first 24 hours
should be monitored closely, and swallowing ability should be
screened when clinically appropriate
1.3.3 Patients with stroke presenting with features indicating dysphagia
or pulmonary aspiration should receive a full clinical assessment of
their swallowing ability by a speech-language pathologist or
appropriately trained specialist who would advise on swallowing ability
and the required consistency of diet and fluids
1.4 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
1.4.1 All patients, whether admitted to hospital or discharged from the
ED, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
1.5 Triage tool for patients with TIA
1.5.1 A standardized triage tool should be used to determine the
appropriate location for the care of patients with TIA
1.6 Initial examinations for TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
1.6.1 Patients with a TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke presenting
within 48 hours of symptom onset or with fluctuating motor or speech
symptoms should undergo immediate vascular imaging of the neck
arteries (carotid ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) unless the patient is clearly
not a candidate for carotid artery revascularization
1.6.2 All other patients (presenting beyond 48 hours) with a TIA or
ischemic stroke should undergo vascular imaging of the brain and
neck arteries as soon as possible
1.7 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 1 Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• Where feasible, EMS should divert patients to regional or district stroke centres if there is suspicion of stroke/TIA
• The process for EMS prenotification of the receiving hospital about a stroke/TIA patient arrival should be better
established to ensure acute stroke teams receive timely and detailed information
• Collaboration between local EMS and institutions that provide stroke services should occur in all stroke networks across
the province to support quality improvement and facilitate access to stroke care
• Ongoing education should be provided to EMS crews about the recognition of stroke/TIA symptoms and regional
medical redirect protocols
• Standardized stroke/TIA assessment and treatment protocols/tools should be developed and used in all Ontario hospital
EDs
• Upon receiving EMS prenotification, the receiving hospital’s acute stroke team should be contacted and called to the ED
(for appropriate patients)
• Sufficient human resources capacity should be ensured so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely
manner
• To facilitate early assessment, hospital-level CTAS I or CTAS II access to diagnostic imaging should be established for
suspected stroke/TIA patients to facilitate early assessment
• A referral process for rapid-assessment TIA and minor stroke units/TIA clinics and provincial stroke-prevention clinics
should be established in all hospitals for patients who are not admitted to hospital
• Efforts to raise public awareness about the symptoms of stroke/TIA and when to contact 911 should continue to be
enhanced and funded

Check which activities in the process text can be expanded into sub-activities and add these sub-activities to the process text. Please note:
1) Only expand important activities, not all of them.
2) Ensure that the process text remains logical when adding sub-activities.
3) Add appropriate gateways when adding activities.
4) When modifying the process text, note whether the newly added activity is a sequential, exclusive, or concurrent relationship.
5) Only expand activities if it's necessary and do not create overly detailed sub-activities.
Here are some examples of expanding activities in process texts into sub-activities. You can refer to them but cannot copy them:
1. 'payment with card/cash' activity with id='activity2' can be expanded to:
   sub-activity:'Payment with card' and 'Payment with cash' 
   activity relations: exclusive
2. 'club interviewid and confimation email' activity with id='activity5' can be expanded to:
   sub-activity:'Interview at the club' and 'Send confirmation email'
   activity relations: sequential
3. 'Submit the materials' activity with id='activity9' can be expanded to:
   sub-activity:'Submit interview materials' and 'Submit examination materials' 
   activity relations: parallel
After extending the activity, number the activity or gateway in addition to the original id. If the sub-activity are exclusive or parallel relationships, you need to add them in the form of gateways when modifying the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

First output which activities can be extended according to the above format (...... can be expanded to:.......) and then give the modified process text. Don't say anything else.

1.3.2 All patients with stroke who are not alert within the first 24 hours
should be monitored closely, and swallowing ability should be
screened when clinically appropriate
1.3.3 Patients with stroke presenting with features indicating dysphagia
or pulmonary aspiration should receive a full clinical assessment of
their swallowing ability by a speech-language pathologist or
appropriately trained specialist who would advise on swallowing ability
and the required consistency of diet and fluids
1.4 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
1.4.1 All patients, whether admitted to hospital or discharged from the
ED, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
1.5 Triage tool for patients with TIA
1.5.1 A standardized triage tool should be used to determine the
appropriate location for the care of patients with TIA
1.6 Initial examinations for TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
1.6.1 Patients with a TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke presenting
within 48 hours of symptom onset or with fluctuating motor or speech
symptoms should undergo immediate vascular imaging of the neck
arteries (carotid ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) unless the patient is clearly
not a candidate for carotid artery revascularization
1.6.2 All other patients (presenting beyond 48 hours) with a TIA or
ischemic stroke should undergo vascular imaging of the brain and
neck arteries as soon as possible
1.7 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 1 Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• Where feasible, EMS should divert patients to regional or district stroke centres if there is suspicion of stroke/TIA
• The process for EMS prenotification of the receiving hospital about a stroke/TIA patient arrival should be better
established to ensure acute stroke teams receive timely and detailed information
• Collaboration between local EMS and institutions that provide stroke services should occur in all stroke networks across
the province to support quality improvement and facilitate access to stroke care
• Ongoing education should be provided to EMS crews about the recognition of stroke/TIA symptoms and regional
medical redirect protocols
• Standardized stroke/TIA assessment and treatment protocols/tools should be developed and used in all Ontario hospital
EDs
• Upon receiving EMS prenotification, the receiving hospital’s acute stroke team should be contacted and called to the ED
(for appropriate patients)
• Sufficient human resources capacity should be ensured so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely
manner
• To facilitate early assessment, hospital-level CTAS I or CTAS II access to diagnostic imaging should be established for
suspected stroke/TIA patients to facilitate early assessment
• A referral process for rapid-assessment TIA and minor stroke units/TIA clinics and provincial stroke-prevention clinics
should be established in all hospitals for patients who are not admitted to hospital
• Efforts to raise public awareness about the symptoms of stroke/TIA and when to contact 911 should continue to be
enhanced and funded

For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.

• creatinine
• glucose
• INR
• partial thromboplastin time
• troponin test (if clinically indicated)
1.3 Assessment and early management of dysphagia
1.3.1 All patients with stroke should be made NPO initially and have
their swallowing ability screened using a simple, valid, reliable, bedside
testing protocol as part of their initial assessment and before initiating
oral medication, fluid, or food
1.3.2 All patients with stroke who are not alert within the first 24 hours
should be monitored closely, and swallowing ability should be
screened when clinically appropriate
1.3.3 Patients with stroke presenting with features indicating dysphagia
or pulmonary aspiration should receive a full clinical assessment of
their swallowing ability by a speech-language pathologist or
appropriately trained specialist who would advise on swallowing ability
and the required consistency of diet and fluids
1.4 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
1.4.1 All patients, whether admitted to hospital or discharged from the
ED, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
1.5 Triage tool for patients with TIA
1.5.1 A standardized triage tool should be used to determine the
appropriate location for the care of patients with TIA
1.6 Initial examinations for TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
1.6.1 Patients with a TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke presenting
within 48 hours of symptom onset or with fluctuating motor or speech
symptoms should undergo immediate vascular imaging of the neck
arteries (carotid ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) unless the patient is clearly
not a candidate for carotid artery revascularization
1.6.2 All other patients (presenting beyond 48 hours) with a TIA or
ischemic stroke should undergo vascular imaging of the brain and
neck arteries as soon as possible

Module 1 Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• Where feasible, EMS should divert patients to regional or district stroke centres if there is suspicion of stroke/TIA
• The process for EMS prenotification of the receiving hospital about a stroke/TIA patient arrival should be better
established to ensure acute stroke teams receive timely and detailed information
• Collaboration between local EMS and institutions that provide stroke services should occur in all stroke networks across
the province to support quality improvement and facilitate access to stroke care
• Ongoing education should be provided to EMS crews about the recognition of stroke/TIA symptoms and regional
medical redirect protocols
• Standardized stroke/TIA assessment and treatment protocols/tools should be developed and used in all Ontario hospital
EDs
• Upon receiving EMS prenotification, the receiving hospital’s acute stroke team should be contacted and called to the ED
(for appropriate patients)
• Sufficient human resources capacity should be ensured so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely
manner
• To facilitate early assessment, hospital-level CTAS I or CTAS II access to diagnostic imaging should be established for
suspected stroke/TIA patients to facilitate early assessment
• A referral process for rapid-assessment TIA and minor stroke units/TIA clinics and provincial stroke-prevention clinics
should be established in all hospitals for patients who are not admitted to hospital
• Efforts to raise public awareness about the symptoms of stroke/TIA and when to contact 911 should continue to be
enhanced and funded

Please check whether there are logic problems and format problems of activities and gateways in the process text, such as the reverse of the order of activities, unreasonable design of gateways, and wrong order of activities or branches. For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained.
Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:

</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 1: Early Assessment
This module identifies best practices for the early assessment of suspected TIA or minor
(nondisabling) stroke. Patients typically present at the ED, but the same practices should be followed
at an outpatient clinic or when patients are directly admitted to acute care. The recommendations
emphasize assessing the patient to inform clinical decision-making and determine the most
appropriate pathway.
Module 1 Recommended Practices 
1.1 Initial evaluation
1.1.1 Rapid initial evaluation should be conducted for airway,
breathing, and circulation
1.2 Initial examinations
1.2.1 All patients should undergo a neurological examination to
determine focal neurological deficits and assess stroke severity on a
standardized stroke scale (NIHSS or CNS for stroke)
1.2.2 All patients should undergo brain imaging (CT or MRI)
immediately
1.2.3 Brain imaging should be interpreted immediately by a health care
provider with expertise in reading CT and/or MRI
1.2.4 All patients should undergo ECG to detect atrial fibrillation and
other acute arrhythmias
1.2.5 A chest x-ray should not delay assessment for thrombolysis 
1.2.6 All patients should have the following blood work:
• CBC
• electrolytes
• creatinine
• glucose
• INR
• partial thromboplastin time
• troponin test (if clinically indicated)
1.3 Assessment and early management of dysphagia
1.3.1 All patients with stroke should be made NPO initially and have
their swallowing ability screened using a simple, valid, reliable, bedside
testing protocol as part of their initial assessment and before initiating
oral medication, fluid, or food
1.3.2 All patients with stroke who are not alert within the first 24 hours
should be monitored closely, and swallowing ability should be
screened when clinically appropriate
1.3.3 Patients with stroke presenting with features indicating dysphagia
or pulmonary aspiration should receive a full clinical assessment of
their swallowing ability by a speech-language pathologist or
appropriately trained specialist who would advise on swallowing ability
and the required consistency of diet and fluids
1.4 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
1.4.1 All patients, whether admitted to hospital or discharged from the
ED, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
1.5 Triage tool for patients with TIA
1.5.1 A standardized triage tool should be used to determine the
appropriate location for the care of patients with TIA
1.6 Initial examinations for TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
1.6.1 Patients with a TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke presenting
within 48 hours of symptom onset or with fluctuating motor or speech
symptoms should undergo immediate vascular imaging of the neck
arteries (carotid ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) unless the patient is clearly
not a candidate for carotid artery revascularization
1.6.2 All other patients (presenting beyond 48 hours) with a TIA or
ischemic stroke should undergo vascular imaging of the brain and
neck arteries as soon as possible
1.7 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke
Management; CBC, complete blood count; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; CNS, Canadian Neurological Scale; CT,
computed tomography; CTA, computed tomography angiography; ECG, electrocardiogram; ED, emergency department; INR, international
normalized ratio; MRA, magnetic resonance angiography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; NHS/NICE, National Collaborating Centre for
Chronic Conditions; NIHSS, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale; NPO, nil per os (nothing by mouth); SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate
Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 1 Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• Where feasible, EMS should divert patients to regional or district stroke centres if there is suspicion of stroke/TIA
• The process for EMS prenotification of the receiving hospital about a stroke/TIA patient arrival should be better
established to ensure acute stroke teams receive timely and detailed information
• Collaboration between local EMS and institutions that provide stroke services should occur in all stroke networks across
the province to support quality improvement and facilitate access to stroke care
• Ongoing education should be provided to EMS crews about the recognition of stroke/TIA symptoms and regional
medical redirect protocols
• Standardized stroke/TIA assessment and treatment protocols/tools should be developed and used in all Ontario hospital
EDs
• Upon receiving EMS prenotification, the receiving hospital’s acute stroke team should be contacted and called to the ED
(for appropriate patients)
• Sufficient human resources capacity should be ensured so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely
manner
• To facilitate early assessment, hospital-level CTAS I or CTAS II access to diagnostic imaging should be established for
suspected stroke/TIA patients to facilitate early assessment
• A referral process for rapid-assessment TIA and minor stroke units/TIA clinics and provincial stroke-prevention clinics
should be established in all hospitals for patients who are not admitted to hospital
• Efforts to raise public awareness about the symptoms of stroke/TIA and when to contact 911 should continue to be
enhanced and funded
Abbreviations: CTAS, Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale; ED, emergency department; EMS, emergency medical services; TIA, transient
ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 1: Early Assessment
This module identifies best practices for the early assessment of suspected TIA or minor
(nondisabling) stroke. Patients typically present at the ED, but the same practices should be followed
at an outpatient clinic or when patients are directly admitted to acute care. The recommendations
emphasize assessing the patient to inform clinical decision-making and determine the most
appropriate pathway.
Module 1 Recommended Practices 
1.1 Initial evaluation
1.1.1 Rapid initial evaluation should be conducted for airway,
breathing, and circulation
1.2 Initial examinations
1.2.1 All patients should undergo a neurological examination to
determine focal neurological deficits and assess stroke severity on a
standardized stroke scale (NIHSS or CNS for stroke)
1.2.2 All patients should undergo brain imaging (CT or MRI)
immediately
1.2.3 Brain imaging should be interpreted immediately by a health care
provider with expertise in reading CT and/or MRI
1.2.4 All patients should undergo ECG to detect atrial fibrillation and
other acute arrhythmias
1.2.5 A chest x-ray should not delay assessment for thrombolysis 
1.2.6 All patients should have the following blood work:
• CBC
• electrolytes
• creatinine
• glucose
• INR
• partial thromboplastin time
• troponin test (if clinically indicated)
1.3 Assessment and early management of dysphagia
1.3.1 All patients with stroke should be made NPO initially and have
their swallowing ability screened using a simple, valid, reliable, bedside
testing protocol as part of their initial assessment and before initiating
oral medication, fluid, or food
1.3.2 All patients with stroke who are not alert within the first 24 hours
should be monitored closely, and swallowing ability should be
screened when clinically appropriate
1.3.3 Patients with stroke presenting with features indicating dysphagia
or pulmonary aspiration should receive a full clinical assessment of
their swallowing ability by a speech-language pathologist or
appropriately trained specialist who would advise on swallowing ability
and the required consistency of diet and fluids
1.4 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
1.4.1 All patients, whether admitted to hospital or discharged from the
ED, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
1.5 Triage tool for patients with TIA
1.5.1 A standardized triage tool should be used to determine the
appropriate location for the care of patients with TIA
1.6 Initial examinations for TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
1.6.1 Patients with a TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke presenting
within 48 hours of symptom onset or with fluctuating motor or speech
symptoms should undergo immediate vascular imaging of the neck
arteries (carotid ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) unless the patient is clearly
not a candidate for carotid artery revascularization
1.6.2 All other patients (presenting beyond 48 hours) with a TIA or
ischemic stroke should undergo vascular imaging of the brain and
neck arteries as soon as possible
1.7 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 1 Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• Where feasible, EMS should divert patients to regional or district stroke centres if there is suspicion of stroke/TIA
• The process for EMS prenotification of the receiving hospital about a stroke/TIA patient arrival should be better
established to ensure acute stroke teams receive timely and detailed information
• Collaboration between local EMS and institutions that provide stroke services should occur in all stroke networks across
the province to support quality improvement and facilitate access to stroke care
• Ongoing education should be provided to EMS crews about the recognition of stroke/TIA symptoms and regional
medical redirect protocols
• Standardized stroke/TIA assessment and treatment protocols/tools should be developed and used in all Ontario hospital
EDs
• Upon receiving EMS prenotification, the receiving hospital’s acute stroke team should be contacted and called to the ED
(for appropriate patients)
• Sufficient human resources capacity should be ensured so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely
manner
• To facilitate early assessment, hospital-level CTAS I or CTAS II access to diagnostic imaging should be established for
suspected stroke/TIA patients to facilitate early assessment
• A referral process for rapid-assessment TIA and minor stroke units/TIA clinics and provincial stroke-prevention clinics
should be established in all hospitals for patients who are not admitted to hospital
• Efforts to raise public awareness about the symptoms of stroke/TIA and when to contact 911 should continue to be
enhanced and funded
