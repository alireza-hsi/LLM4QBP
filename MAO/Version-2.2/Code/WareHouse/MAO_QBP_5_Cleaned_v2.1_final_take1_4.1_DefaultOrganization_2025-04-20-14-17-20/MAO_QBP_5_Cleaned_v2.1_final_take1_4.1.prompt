Module 1: Care in the Emergency Department
This module identifies recommended practices for the early assessment of suspected hip fracture
patients. Although patients typically present to the emergency department (ED), the same practices should be followed at an outpatient clinic or when patients are directly admitted to the acute care setting. The recommendations emphasize timely care from clinical staff and the importance of recording a comprehensive assessment of patient factors in order to inform clinical decision-making on the most appropriate pathway trajectory, plan discharge to the most appropriate setting and provide baseline values for performance measurement.
Recommendation Guidelines
1. Care Pathway for Hip Fracture
• Every hospital should have a hip fracture care
pathway that clearly specifies perioperative
patient goals by day of stay

2. Rapid Medical Attention in the ED
● 90% of patients arriving at the ED should be seen
● 90% of patients should receive a consultation with
an orthopedic surgeon within 2 hours

3. ED Assessment and Diagnostics
• Assess and document the following information
while patient is in the ED to inform treatment and
discharge decisions:
- Reason for the fall
- Fluid balance
- Pressure sore risk
- Hydration and nutrition
- Pain
- Temperature
- Other collateral injuries
- Tests for appropriate blood work
- X-rays
- Assess comorbid conditions
- Current drug therapy, including any
anticoagulants
- Continence
- Pre-fracture functional ability and mobility
- Physical and functional level
- Mental state based on pre-morbid functioning
level, using a validated screening tool such as
MMSE, MOCA, or CAM
- Social circumstances, including caregiver
status, existing community supports, family
involvement

4. Patient Management Within the ED
• Medication reconciliation should be completed
within the ED, using a standardized form
• Steps should be taken within the ED to manage
patients' hydration, pain, risk of delirium and risk
of pressure sores
5. Inpatient Admission
• 90% of patients should be admitted within 4
hours spent in the ED

6. Presenting to Non-Surgical Hospitals
• Patients presenting to non-surgical hospitals
should be medically stabilized while waiting for
expeditious transfer to a surgical hospital for
operation
• Patients admitted to non-surgical hospitals
should still receive surgery within 48 hours of
their initial presentation
• LHINs and hospitals should ensure that all non-
surgical hospitals have formal protocols for timely
transfer to surgical hospitals for surgery, followed
by repatriation to patients' local hospitals
