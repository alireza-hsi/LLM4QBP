Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke

Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
