**task_prompt**: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack. The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel. Module 3a Implementation Considerations General considerations • All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR • Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up • Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack. |

| **phase_prompt** | task: {task} process text: {refinement_process_text} Check which activities in the process text can be expanded into sub-activities and add these sub-activities to the process text. Please note: 1) Only expand important activities, not all of them. 2) Ensure that the process text remains logical when adding sub-activities. 3) Add appropriate gateways when adding activities. 4) When modifying the process text, note whether the newly added activity is a sequential, exclusive, or concurrent relationship. 5) Only expand activities if it's necessary and do not create overly detailed sub-activities. Here are some examples of expanding activities in process texts into sub-activities. You can refer to them but cannot copy them: 1. 'payment with card/cash' activity with id='activity2' can be expanded to:    sub-activity:'Payment with card' and 'Payment with cash'     activity relations: exclusive 2. 'club interviewid and confimation email' activity with id='activity5' can be expanded to:    sub-activity:'Interview at the club' and 'Send confirmation email'    activity relations: sequential 3. 'Submit the materials' activity with id='activity9' can be expanded to:    sub-activity:'Submit interview materials' and 'Submit examination materials'     activity relations: parallel After extending the activity, number the activity or gateway in addition to the original id. If the sub-activity are exclusive or parallel relationships, you need to add them in the form of gateways when modifying the process text: {format} First output which activities can be extended according to the above format (...... can be expanded to:.......) and then give the modified process text.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Check which activities in the process text can be expanded into sub-activities and add these sub-activities to the process text. Please note:
1) Only expand important activities, not all of them.
2) Ensure that the process text remains logical when adding sub-activities.
3) Add appropriate gateways when adding activities.
4) When modifying the process text, note whether the newly added activity is a sequential, exclusive, or concurrent relationship.
5) Only expand activities if it's necessary and do not create overly detailed sub-activities.
Here are some examples of expanding activities in process texts into sub-activities. You can refer to them but cannot copy them:
1. 'payment with card/cash' activity with id='activity2' can be expanded to:
   sub-activity:'Payment with card' and 'Payment with cash' 
   activity relations: exclusive
2. 'club interviewid and confimation email' activity with id='activity5' can be expanded to:
   sub-activity:'Interview at the club' and 'Send confirmation email'
   activity relations: sequential
3. 'Submit the materials' activity with id='activity9' can be expanded to:
   sub-activity:'Submit interview materials' and 'Submit examination materials' 
   activity relations: parallel
After extending the activity, number the activity or gateway in addition to the original id. If the sub-activity are exclusive or parallel relationships, you need to add them in the form of gateways when modifying the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

First output which activities can be extended according to the above format (...... can be expanded to:.......) and then give the modified process text. Don't say anything else.

• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a

Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack. The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel. Module 3a Implementation Considerations General considerations • All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR • Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up • Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack. |

| **phase_prompt** | Current process text: {reviewed_process_text} Extra knowledge: 1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity. 2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch. 3) All tests, including any type of imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert. 4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time toget results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity. 5) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be put in a single activity. 6) Assessing airway, breathing, and circulation is called ABC testing and is ONE activity. 7) Neurological examination and imaging results are needed to Evaluate patients for endovascular therapy. However, they can be in parallel to other activities that don’ t need these results. 8) CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, INR, partial thromboplastin time, and troponin test are all types of blood tests, and they can all be in ONE blood works activity if they are at the same place of a process. 9) Anti platelet therapy has 4 general options(ASA, Clopidogrel, Extended - release Dipyridamole + Aspirin(Aggrenox), and rectal or gastric ASA if can 't swallow) and they should be indicated right after each initiation of antiplatelet therapy activity in the process.  10) Temperature reducing activities should happen in parallel. 11) The activity 'chest x-ray should not delay...' should have a skip flow as it should be skipped if not needed. 12) If activity 'should be evaluated in the ED to be considered for admission to hospital' is needed, it should happen in parallel and not in sequence. 13) When patients should be screened / assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression in the same part of the process, they should be merged into one activity along with forwarding the results. 14) Assessments related and needed to formulating management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan. 15) Formulating the management plan should happen before the activities and assessments after it. 16) Between 24 - 48 hour of stroke onset IF no contradiction, mobilization is encouraged. However, in the first 24 hour it is only encouraged IF clinical judgement suggests otherwise, it is not.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be

prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any type of imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time toget results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.
5) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be put in a single activity.
6) Assessing airway, breathing, and circulation is called ABC testing and is ONE activity.
7) Neurological examination and imaging results are needed to Evaluate patients for endovascular therapy. However, they can be in parallel to other activities that don’ t need these results.
8) CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, INR, partial thromboplastin time, and troponin test are all types of blood tests, and they can all be in ONE blood works activity if they are at the same place of a process.
9) Anti platelet therapy has 4 general options(ASA, Clopidogrel, Extended - release Dipyridamole + Aspirin(Aggrenox), and rectal or gastric ASA if can 't swallow) and they should be indicated right after each initiation of antiplatelet therapy activity in the process. 
10) Temperature reducing activities should happen in parallel.
11) The activity 'chest x-ray should not delay...' should have a skip flow as it should be skipped if not needed.
12) If activity 'should be evaluated in the ED to be considered for admission to hospital' is needed, it should happen in parallel and not in sequence.
13) When patients should be screened / assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression in the same part of the process, they should be merged into one activity along with forwarding the results.
14) Assessments related and needed to formulating management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan.
15) Formulating the management plan should happen before the activities and assessments after it.
16) Between 24 - 48 hour of stroke onset IF no contradiction, mobilization is encouraged. However, in the first 24 hour it is only encouraged IF clinical judgement suggests otherwise, it is not.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Merge the activities "Assess patient within 48 hours of admission" and "Formulate management plan based on assessment" with the related assessments ("Select appropriate standardized, valid assessment tools" and "Evaluate stroke-related impairments and functional status using selected tools") into a single activity, as all these assessments are needed to formulate the management plan.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 14, assessments related and needed to formulating the management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan. This streamlines the process, reduces redundancy, and more accurately reflects the clinical workflow where assessment and management planning are closely integrated.

of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening

Suggested modification: Merge the activities "Assess patient within 48 hours of admission" and "Formulate management plan based on assessment" with the related assessments ("Select appropriate standardized, valid assessment tools" and "Evaluate stroke-related impairments and functional status using selected tools") into a single activity, as all these assessments are needed to formulate the management plan.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 14, assessments related and needed to formulating the management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan. This streamlines the process, reduces redundancy, and more accurately reflects the clinical workflow where assessment and management planning are closely integrated.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>

At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any type of imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time toget results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.
5) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be put in a single activity.
6) Assessing airway, breathing, and circulation is called ABC testing and is ONE activity.
7) Neurological examination and imaging results are needed to Evaluate patients for endovascular therapy. However, they can be in parallel to other activities that don’ t need these results.
8) CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, INR, partial thromboplastin time, and troponin test are all types of blood tests, and they can all be in ONE blood works activity if they are at the same place of a process.
9) Anti platelet therapy has 4 general options(ASA, Clopidogrel, Extended - release Dipyridamole + Aspirin(Aggrenox), and rectal or gastric ASA if can 't swallow) and they should be indicated right after each initiation of antiplatelet therapy activity in the process. 
10) Temperature reducing activities should happen in parallel.
11) The activity 'chest x-ray should not delay...' should have a skip flow as it should be skipped if not needed.
12) If activity 'should be evaluated in the ED to be considered for admission to hospital' is needed, it should happen in parallel and not in sequence.
13) When patients should be screened / assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression in the same part of the process, they should be merged into one activity along with forwarding the results.
14) Assessments related and needed to formulating management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan.
15) Formulating the management plan should happen before the activities and assessments after it.
16) Between 24 - 48 hour of stroke onset IF no contradiction, mobilization is encouraged. However, in the first 24 hour it is only encouraged IF clinical judgement suggests otherwise, it is not.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Merge the activities "Within 48 hours of admission, select and use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate stroke-related impairments and functional status, and formulate a management plan based on assessment results" (activity6) and "Formulate a management plan" (currently implicit in activity6) into a single activity, and ensure this merged activity occurs before any subsequent assessments or interventions that depend on the management plan.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 14 and 15, assessments related and needed to formulating the management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan, and this should happen before activities and assessments that follow from the management plan. This ensures clarity, reduces redundancy, and aligns the process with best practices for clinical workflow.

the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency

professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

Suggested modification: Merge the activities "Within 48 hours of admission, select and use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate stroke-related impairments and functional status, and formulate a management plan based on assessment results" (activity6) and "Formulate a management plan" (currently implicit in activity6) into a single activity, and ensure this merged activity occurs before any subsequent assessments or interventions that depend on the management plan.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 14 and 15, assessments related and needed to formulating the management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan, and this should happen before activities and assessments that follow from the management plan. This ensures clarity, reduces redundancy, and aligns the process with best practices for clinical workflow.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>

At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

However, they can be in parallel to other activities that don’ t need these results. 8) CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, INR, partial thromboplastin time, and troponin test are all types of blood tests, and they can all be in ONE blood works activity if they are at the same place of a process. 9) Anti platelet therapy has 4 general options(ASA, Clopidogrel, Extended - release Dipyridamole + Aspirin(Aggrenox), and rectal or gastric ASA if can 't swallow) and they should be indicated right after each initiation of antiplatelet therapy activity in the process.  10) Temperature reducing activities should happen in parallel. 11) The activity 'chest x-ray should not delay...' should have a skip flow as it should be skipped if not needed. 12) If activity 'should be evaluated in the ED to be considered for admission to hospital' is needed, it should happen in parallel and not in sequence. 13) When patients should be screened / assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression in the same part of the process, they should be merged into one activity along with forwarding the results. 14) Assessments related and needed to formulating management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan. 15) Formulating the management plan should happen before the activities and assessments after it. 16) Between 24 - 48 hour of stroke onset IF no contradiction, mobilization is encouraged. However, in the first 24 hour it is only encouraged IF clinical judgement suggests otherwise, it is not.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any type of imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time toget results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.
5) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be put in a single activity.
6) Assessing airway, breathing, and circulation is called ABC testing and is ONE activity.
7) Neurological examination and imaging results are needed to Evaluate patients for endovascular therapy. However, they can be in parallel to other activities that don’ t need these results.
8) CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, INR, partial thromboplastin time, and troponin test are all types of blood tests, and they can all be in ONE blood works activity if they are at the same place of a process.
9) Anti platelet therapy has 4 general options(ASA, Clopidogrel, Extended - release Dipyridamole + Aspirin(Aggrenox), and rectal or gastric ASA if can 't swallow) and they should be indicated right after each initiation of antiplatelet therapy activity in the process. 
10) Temperature reducing activities should happen in parallel.
11) The activity 'chest x-ray should not delay...' should have a skip flow as it should be skipped if not needed.
12) If activity 'should be evaluated in the ED to be considered for admission to hospital' is needed, it should happen in parallel and not in sequence.
13) When patients should be screened / assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression in the same part of the process, they should be merged into one activity along with forwarding the results.
14) Assessments related and needed to formulating management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan.
15) Formulating the management plan should happen before the activities and assessments after it.
16) Between 24 - 48 hour of stroke onset IF no contradiction, mobilization is encouraged. However, in the first 24 hour it is only encouraged IF clinical judgement suggests otherwise, it is not.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Merge the activities related to stroke unit admission, ensuring dedicated interprofessional team, 7-day availability, and team expertise/education into a single activity at the start of the acute inpatient admission branch, as per extra knowledge point 5.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 5, activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be combined into a single activity. This streamlines the process, reduces redundancy, and clarifies that these organizational prerequisites must be established before patient-specific clinical activities begin. This also aligns with extra knowledge point 2, which prioritizes these activities as initial steps in their respective flow or branch.

Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR

Advisor's suggestion:
Suggested modification: Merge the activities related to stroke unit admission, ensuring dedicated interprofessional team, 7-day availability, and team expertise/education into a single activity at the start of the acute inpatient admission branch, as per extra knowledge point 5.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 5, activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be combined into a single activity. This streamlines the process, reduces redundancy, and clarifies that these organizational prerequisites must be established before patient-specific clinical activities begin. This also aligns with extra knowledge point 2, which prioritizes these activities as initial steps in their respective flow or branch.

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

However, they can be in parallel to other activities that don’ t need these results. 8) CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, INR, partial thromboplastin time, and troponin test are all types of blood tests, and they can all be in ONE blood works activity if they are at the same place of a process. 9) Anti platelet therapy has 4 general options(ASA, Clopidogrel, Extended - release Dipyridamole + Aspirin(Aggrenox), and rectal or gastric ASA if can 't swallow) and they should be indicated right after each initiation of antiplatelet therapy activity in the process.  10) Temperature reducing activities should happen in parallel. 11) The activity 'chest x-ray should not delay...' should have a skip flow as it should be skipped if not needed. 12) If activity 'should be evaluated in the ED to be considered for admission to hospital' is needed, it should happen in parallel and not in sequence. 13) When patients should be screened / assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression in the same part of the process, they should be merged into one activity along with forwarding the results. 14) Assessments related and needed to formulating management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan. 15) Formulating the management plan should happen before the activities and assessments after it. 16) Between 24 - 48 hour of stroke onset IF no contradiction, mobilization is encouraged.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any type of imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time toget results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.
5) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be put in a single activity.
6) Assessing airway, breathing, and circulation is called ABC testing and is ONE activity.
7) Neurological examination and imaging results are needed to Evaluate patients for endovascular therapy. However, they can be in parallel to other activities that don’ t need these results.
8) CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, INR, partial thromboplastin time, and troponin test are all types of blood tests, and they can all be in ONE blood works activity if they are at the same place of a process.
9) Anti platelet therapy has 4 general options(ASA, Clopidogrel, Extended - release Dipyridamole + Aspirin(Aggrenox), and rectal or gastric ASA if can 't swallow) and they should be indicated right after each initiation of antiplatelet therapy activity in the process. 
10) Temperature reducing activities should happen in parallel.
11) The activity 'chest x-ray should not delay...' should have a skip flow as it should be skipped if not needed.
12) If activity 'should be evaluated in the ED to be considered for admission to hospital' is needed, it should happen in parallel and not in sequence.
13) When patients should be screened / assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression in the same part of the process, they should be merged into one activity along with forwarding the results.
14) Assessments related and needed to formulating management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan.
15) Formulating the management plan should happen before the activities and assessments after it.
16) Between 24 - 48 hour of stroke onset IF no contradiction, mobilization is encouraged. However, in the first 24 hour it is only encouraged IF clinical judgement suggests otherwise, it is not.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Merge the activities "Within 48 hours of admission, select and use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate stroke-related impairments and functional status, and formulate a management plan based on assessment results" and "Formulate a management plan" into a single activity that includes both assessment and management plan formulation, and ensure this merged activity occurs before any subsequent assessments or interventions.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 14 and 15, assessments related and needed to formulating the management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan, and formulating the management plan should happen before the activities and assessments after it. This ensures clarity, reduces redundancy, and aligns the process with best practices for process modeling and clinical workflow.

You model the process of a clinical practice guideline to a clinical pathway.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Advisor's suggestion:
Suggested modification: Merge the activities "Within 48 hours of admission, select and use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate stroke-related impairments and functional status, and formulate a management plan based on assessment results" and "Formulate a management plan" into a single activity that includes both assessment and management plan formulation, and ensure this merged activity occurs before any subsequent assessments or interventions.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 14 and 15, assessments related and needed to formulating the management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan, and formulating the management plan should happen before the activities and assessments after it. This ensures clarity, reduces redundancy, and aligns the process with best practices for process modeling and clinical workflow.

    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

However, they can be in parallel to other activities that don’ t need these results. 8) CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, INR, partial thromboplastin time, and troponin test are all types of blood tests, and they can all be in ONE blood works activity if they are at the same place of a process. 9) Anti platelet therapy has 4 general options(ASA, Clopidogrel, Extended - release Dipyridamole + Aspirin(Aggrenox), and rectal or gastric ASA if can 't swallow) and they should be indicated right after each initiation of antiplatelet therapy activity in the process.  10) Temperature reducing activities should happen in parallel. 11) The activity 'chest x-ray should not delay...' should have a skip flow as it should be skipped if not needed. 12) If activity 'should be evaluated in the ED to be considered for admission to hospital' is needed, it should happen in parallel and not in sequence. 13) When patients should be screened / assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression in the same part of the process, they should be merged into one activity along with forwarding the results. 14) Assessments related and needed to formulating management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan. 15) Formulating the management plan should happen before the activities and assessments after it. 16) Between 24 - 48 hour of stroke onset IF no contradiction, mobilization is encouraged.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any type of imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time toget results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.
5) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be put in a single activity.
6) Assessing airway, breathing, and circulation is called ABC testing and is ONE activity.
7) Neurological examination and imaging results are needed to Evaluate patients for endovascular therapy. However, they can be in parallel to other activities that don’ t need these results.
8) CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, INR, partial thromboplastin time, and troponin test are all types of blood tests, and they can all be in ONE blood works activity if they are at the same place of a process.
9) Anti platelet therapy has 4 general options(ASA, Clopidogrel, Extended - release Dipyridamole + Aspirin(Aggrenox), and rectal or gastric ASA if can 't swallow) and they should be indicated right after each initiation of antiplatelet therapy activity in the process. 
10) Temperature reducing activities should happen in parallel.
11) The activity 'chest x-ray should not delay...' should have a skip flow as it should be skipped if not needed.
12) If activity 'should be evaluated in the ED to be considered for admission to hospital' is needed, it should happen in parallel and not in sequence.
13) When patients should be screened / assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression in the same part of the process, they should be merged into one activity along with forwarding the results.
14) Assessments related and needed to formulating management plan should be merged into one activity along with formulating the management plan.
15) Formulating the management plan should happen before the activities and assessments after it.
16) Between 24 - 48 hour of stroke onset IF no contradiction, mobilization is encouraged. However, in the first 24 hour it is only encouraged IF clinical judgement suggests otherwise, it is not.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Merge the activity "Within 48 hours of admission, select and use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate stroke-related impairments and functional status, and formulate a management plan based on assessment results" (activity3_merged) with the management plan formulation, and ensure this merged activity occurs before any subsequent assessments or interventions (such as AlphaFIM, VTE risk assessment, mobilization, hydration, nutrition assessment, etc.) in the process flow.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 14 and 15, all assessments required to formulate the management plan should be merged into one activity, and the management plan should be formulated before subsequent activities and assessments. This ensures that the management plan is informed by the initial comprehensive assessment and guides subsequent care activities, improving process clarity and clinical logic.

Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR

Advisor's suggestion:
Suggested modification: Merge the activity "Within 48 hours of admission, select and use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate stroke-related impairments and functional status, and formulate a management plan based on assessment results" (activity3_merged) with the management plan formulation, and ensure this merged activity occurs before any subsequent assessments or interventions (such as AlphaFIM, VTE risk assessment, mobilization, hydration, nutrition assessment, etc.) in the process flow.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 14 and 15, all assessments required to formulate the management plan should be merged into one activity, and the management plan should be formulated before subsequent activities and assessments. This ensures that the management plan is informed by the initial comprehensive assessment and guides subsequent care activities, improving process clarity and clinical logic.

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

[You're a Knowledge Graph Advisor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your job is to review process models and provide actionable suggestions for improvement, one at a time.
You use extra knowledge provided to you to inform your suggestions. Your main responsibilities include giving suggestions and your reasoning to the process design expert.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Please check whether there are logic problems and format problems of activities and gateways in the process text, such as the reverse of the order of activities, unreasonable design of gateways, and wrong order of activities or branches. For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained.
Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:

    <activity role='recipient' action='sign for package' objects='package' id='activity8'/>
  </sequenceGateway>
</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up

Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: The activity with id='activity3_merged' ("Within 48 hours of admission, select and use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate stroke-related impairments and functional status, and formulate a management plan based on assessment results") is placed before the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', but some of the parallel activities (e.g., AlphaFIM assessment, risk assessment for venous thromboembolism, nutrition/hydration assessment) are part of the initial comprehensive assessment and should logically occur together or immediately after the initial assessment, not in parallel with it.

Suggested modification: Move the activity with id='activity3_merged' inside the parallel gateway as a branch, or clarify the sequence such that the initial assessment and management plan formulation are completed before the parallel gateway, and only the follow-up assessments (AlphaFIM, VTE risk, nutrition/hydration, etc.) are parallelized.

Reason: The initial comprehensive assessment and management plan formulation should be completed before the specialized assessments (AlphaFIM, VTE risk, etc.) are conducted in parallel. This ensures that the process reflects the correct clinical workflow and avoids duplication or confusion about the timing and responsibility for assessments.

3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

suggestion:
Problem: The activity with id='activity3_merged' ("Within 48 hours of admission, select and use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate stroke-related impairments and functional status, and formulate a management plan based on assessment results") is placed before the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', but some of the parallel activities (e.g., AlphaFIM assessment, risk assessment for venous thromboembolism, nutrition/hydration assessment) are part of the initial comprehensive assessment and should logically occur together or immediately after the initial assessment, not in parallel with it.

Suggested modification: Move the activity with id='activity3_merged' inside the parallel gateway as a branch, or clarify the sequence such that the initial assessment and management plan formulation are completed before the parallel gateway, and only the follow-up assessments (AlphaFIM, VTE risk, nutrition/hydration, etc.) are parallelized.

Reason: The initial comprehensive assessment and management plan formulation should be completed before the specialized assessments (AlphaFIM, VTE risk, etc.) are conducted in parallel. This ensures that the process reflects the correct clinical workflow and avoids duplication or confusion about the timing and responsibility for assessments.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>

At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

[You're a process design reviewer. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway. When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text: {format} Please note: 1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me.  2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else. |

Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),

    <activity role='recipient' action='sign for package' objects='package' id='activity8'/>
  </sequenceGateway>
</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

Problem: The activity with id='activity3_merged' ("Within 48 hours of admission, select and use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate stroke-related impairments and functional status, and formulate a management plan based on assessment results") is placed before the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', but some of the activities inside the parallel gateway (such as AlphaFIM assessment, risk assessment for venous thromboembolism, nutrition and hydration assessment) are also part of the initial comprehensive assessment and should logically occur together or immediately after the initial assessment, not in parallel with it. This creates a sequencing and logic issue.

Suggested modification: Move the activity with id='activity3_merged' inside the parallel gateway as a separate branch, so that all initial assessments and management planning activities are conducted in parallel within the first 48 hours. Alternatively, clarify the scope of 'activity3_merged' to exclude the assessments already covered in the parallel branches, ensuring there is no overlap or sequencing confusion.

Reason: All initial assessments (functional, AlphaFIM, VTE risk, nutrition/hydration) should be coordinated and either performed in parallel or in a clearly defined sequence to avoid duplication and ensure logical process flow. Placing them together in the parallel gateway reflects the multidisciplinary, concurrent nature of acute stroke assessment and planning.

of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements

task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated

suggestion:
Problem: The activity with id='activity3_merged' ("Within 48 hours of admission, select and use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate stroke-related impairments and functional status, and formulate a management plan based on assessment results") is placed before the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', but some of the activities inside the parallel gateway (such as AlphaFIM assessment, risk assessment for venous thromboembolism, nutrition and hydration assessment) are also part of the initial comprehensive assessment and should logically occur together or immediately after the initial assessment, not in parallel with it. This creates a sequencing and logic issue.

Suggested modification: Move the activity with id='activity3_merged' inside the parallel gateway as a separate branch, so that all initial assessments and management planning activities are conducted in parallel within the first 48 hours. Alternatively, clarify the scope of 'activity3_merged' to exclude the assessments already covered in the parallel branches, ensuring there is no overlap or sequencing confusion.

Reason: All initial assessments (functional, AlphaFIM, VTE risk, nutrition/hydration) should be coordinated and either performed in parallel or in a clearly defined sequence to avoid duplication and ensure logical process flow. Placing them together in the parallel gateway reflects the multidisciplinary, concurrent nature of acute stroke assessment and planning.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>

  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack. The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel. Module 3a Implementation Considerations General considerations • All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR • Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up • Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack. |

| **phase_prompt** | task: {task} process text: {reviewed_process_text} Please check whether there are logic problems and format problems of activities and gateways in the process text, such as the reverse of the order of activities, unreasonable design of gateways, and wrong order of activities or branches. For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway. When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text: {format} Please note: 1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me.  2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else. |

This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: The branch with id='branch8' inside the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1' contains an activity with id='activity11' ("Ensure use of standardized, validated assessment tools (preferably electronic and linked to EHR)") which is a general team-level quality assurance/check activity, not a patient-specific, time-bound clinical action. Placing this activity in parallel with direct patient care activities (such as assessment, mobilization, hydration, etc.) is logically inappropriate, as it is not a discrete, parallelizable clinical step but rather an ongoing process or prerequisite.

Suggested modification: Remove the branch with id='branch8' and the activity with id='activity11' from the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'. Instead, place the activity with id='activity11' as a standalone activity before the parallel gateway, immediately after the patient is admitted to the stroke unit (activity2).

Reason: The use of standardized, validated assessment tools (preferably electronic and linked to EHR) is a prerequisite and ongoing quality assurance measure for the stroke unit team, not a parallel clinical action for each patient. It should be established before patient-specific clinical activities begin, ensuring that all subsequent assessments and care are performed using these tools.

Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.

venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

suggestion:
Problem: The branch with id='branch8' inside the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1' contains an activity with id='activity11' ("Ensure use of standardized, validated assessment tools (preferably electronic and linked to EHR)") which is a general team-level quality assurance/check activity, not a patient-specific, time-bound clinical action. Placing this activity in parallel with direct patient care activities (such as assessment, mobilization, hydration, etc.) is logically inappropriate, as it is not a discrete, parallelizable clinical step but rather an ongoing process or prerequisite.

Suggested modification: Remove the branch with id='branch8' and the activity with id='activity11' from the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'. Instead, place the activity with id='activity11' as a standalone activity before the parallel gateway, immediately after the patient is admitted to the stroke unit (activity2).

Reason: The use of standardized, validated assessment tools (preferably electronic and linked to EHR) is a prerequisite and ongoing quality assurance measure for the stroke unit team, not a parallel clinical action for each patient. It should be established before patient-specific clinical activities begin, ensuring that all subsequent assessments and care are performed using these tools.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>

</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>

    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be

definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway. When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text: {format} Please note: 1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested.

Placing this activity in parallel with direct patient care activities (such as assessment, mobilization, hydration, etc.) is logically inappropriate, as it is not a discrete, parallelizable clinical step but rather an ongoing process or prerequisite.\n\nSuggested modification: Remove the branch with id=\'branch8\' and the activity with id=\'activity11\' from the parallel gateway with id=\'parallelgateway1\'. Instead, place the activity with id=\'activity11\' as a standalone activity before the parallel gateway, immediately after the patient is admitted to the stroke unit (activity2).\n\nReason: The use of standardized, validated assessment tools (preferably electronic and linked to EHR) is a prerequisite and ongoing quality assurance measure for the stroke unit team, not a parallel clinical action for each patient.

This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon

   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: The activity 'Ensure use of standardized, validated assessment tools (preferably electronic and linked to EHR)' with id='activity11' is placed after admission to the stroke unit but before the parallel gateway where actual assessments are performed. However, this activity is not a discrete action but rather an ongoing requirement for all subsequent assessment activities, and its placement as a separate activity may cause confusion about its timing and execution.

Suggested modification: Remove the standalone activity with id='activity11' and instead clarify in the descriptions of assessment-related activities (such as id='activity3_merged', id='activity4', id='activity5', id='activity8') that standardized, validated (preferably electronic) tools must be used. Alternatively, if you wish to keep it as a requirement, it should be represented as a prerequisite or embedded as a note, not as a discrete activity in the process flow.

Reason: The use of standardized, validated assessment tools is a requirement for how assessments are performed, not a separate step in the process. Placing it as a standalone activity may imply it is a one-time action rather than an ongoing standard for all assessments, which could lead to misinterpretation or duplication of effort.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated

suggestion:
Problem: The activity 'Ensure use of standardized, validated assessment tools (preferably electronic and linked to EHR)' with id='activity11' is placed after admission to the stroke unit but before the parallel gateway where actual assessments are performed. However, this activity is not a discrete action but rather an ongoing requirement for all subsequent assessment activities, and its placement as a separate activity may cause confusion about its timing and execution.

Suggested modification: Remove the standalone activity with id='activity11' and instead clarify in the descriptions of assessment-related activities (such as id='activity3_merged', id='activity4', id='activity5', id='activity8') that standardized, validated (preferably electronic) tools must be used. Alternatively, if you wish to keep it as a requirement, it should be represented as a prerequisite or embedded as a note, not as a discrete activity in the process flow.

Reason: The use of standardized, validated assessment tools is a requirement for how assessments are performed, not a separate step in the process. Placing it as a standalone activity may imply it is a one-time action rather than an ongoing standard for all assessments, which could lead to misinterpretation or duplication of effort.

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

[You're a process design reviewer. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.

dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Please check whether there are logic problems and format problems of activities and gateways in the process text, such as the reverse of the order of activities, unreasonable design of gateways, and wrong order of activities or branches. For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained.

    <activity role='recipient' action='sign for package' objects='package' id='activity8'/>
  </sequenceGateway>
</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: The activities 'Conduct secondary prevention assessment' (id='activity12') and 'Initiate secondary prevention therapies' (id='activity13') are placed after the parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1'), but according to the clinical pathway, secondary prevention assessment and therapies should be initiated in parallel with other acute care activities, not sequentially after all parallel activities are completed.

Suggested modification: Move the activities 'Conduct secondary prevention assessment' (id='activity12') and 'Initiate secondary prevention therapies' (id='activity13') into separate branches within the parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1').

Reason: Initiating secondary prevention assessment and therapies should occur concurrently with other acute care interventions to ensure timely and integrated care, as recommended in the best practice guidelines. Placing these activities after the parallel gateway implies they occur only after all other acute care activities are completed, which is not clinically appropriate.

3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

suggestion:
Problem: The activities 'Conduct secondary prevention assessment' (id='activity12') and 'Initiate secondary prevention therapies' (id='activity13') are placed after the parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1'), but according to the clinical pathway, secondary prevention assessment and therapies should be initiated in parallel with other acute care activities, not sequentially after all parallel activities are completed.

Suggested modification: Move the activities 'Conduct secondary prevention assessment' (id='activity12') and 'Initiate secondary prevention therapies' (id='activity13') into separate branches within the parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1').

Reason: Initiating secondary prevention assessment and therapies should occur concurrently with other acute care interventions to ensure timely and integrated care, as recommended in the best practice guidelines. Placing these activities after the parallel gateway implies they occur only after all other acute care activities are completed, which is not clinically appropriate.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>

At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

[You're a process design reviewer. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

[You're a process design reviewer. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

[2025-03-07 08:51:32 INFO] Process design reviewer: **Process design reviewer<->Team leader on : AddAPI, turn 0**

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke
Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]
