Module 2: Early Treatment
This module identifies best practices for the ED treatment of TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke. The
majority of TIA patients and some patients with minor stroke do not require admission to hospital
and should be referred to an urgent TIA/minor stroke unit/TIA clinic/stroke-prevention clinic or
comparable ambulatory care setting for rapid diagnostic and medical evaluation. All patients should
be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10).
Module 2 Recommended Practices 
2.1 Glucose management
2.1.1 Hypoglycemia should be corrected immediately
2.1.2 Blood glucose measurement should be repeated if the first
random glucose value is > 11 mmol/L
2.2 Body temperature
2.2.1 Temperature should be evaluated as part of routine vital signs
every 4 hours for first 48 hours
For temperature > 37.5 C:
• initiate temperature-reducing measures
• investigate potential infection
• initiate antipyretic and antimicrobial therapy as required
2.3 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
2.3.1 All patients, whether admitted to hospital or discharged, should
be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention
assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
2.4 Management of patients with TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
2.4.1 The following OHTAC recommendations should be followed:
• OHTAC recommends that patients presenting with a TIA with high-
risk featuresa or a minor strokeb undergo a brain CT scan and
initiation of antiplatelet therapy (provided this is not contraindicated)
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours after symptom onset,
followed by other stroke-prevention treatments tailored to each
patient. With respect to the location of care, OHTAC recommends
that:
o such immediate care be provided at a specialized TIA/minor
stroke clinicc
o where delays to accessing a specialized TIA/minor stroke clinic
pose risks to patient health, evaluation (as outlined above) occur
at an appropriately resourced ED, and further consideration be
given to inpatient evaluation and management for stroke
prevention. OHTAC further recommends the establishment of
accreditation standards for TIA/minor stroke care to ensure
equitable access to appropriate, high-quality care, irrespective of
the location of initial presentation
o where medical attention has been sought after 48 hours from
symptom onset, patients be referred for evaluation at a
specialized TIA/minor stroke clinic or alternatively an outpatient
clinic with stroke-prevention servicesd within 24 hours of initial
presentation
• OHTAC recommends that patients presenting with a TIA without
high-risk featuresa undergo a brain CT scan and initiation of
antiplatelet therapy (provided this is not contraindicated) as soon as
possible and no later than 24 hours after initial presentation,
followed by referral to an outpatient clinic with stroke-prevention
servicesd for comprehensive evaluation and management within 1
month of symptom onset
2.4.2 Some TIA patients, such as those who present with fluctuating or
crescendo hemibodye motor weakness, sensory loss, or speech
difficulty, should be evaluated in the ED to be considered for admission
to hospital
2.4.3 Patients with TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke who are not on
an antiplatelet agent at the time of presentation should be started on
antiplatelet therapy immediately with 1 of the following after brain
imaging has excluded intracranial hemorrhage:
• ASA 160 mg loading dose, followed by enteric coated ASA (81–
325 mg) daily. Most patients should be on a maintenance dose of
81 mg/day
• clopidogrel 300 mg loading dose, followed by 75 mg/day
• extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg/ASA 25 mg bid (load with
ASA 160 mg first)
2.4.4 Rectal or gastric ASA should be offered as necessary, such as
for patients who fail swallowing screening
2.5–2.8 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

aSymptoms consistent with a hemispheric event, including sudden hemiparesis, speech difficulties, or monocular vision loss, and/or known high
risk conditions associated with stroke, including atrial fibrillation (especially if inadequately anticoagulated) or known carotid artery
atherosclerosis with > 50% stenosis (narrowing) on the side consistent with the hemispheric event.
bPatients with very mild persistent symptoms or no residual symptoms but with a small asymptomatic infarct (stroke) on imaging
cA clinic with stroke expertise and the resources to conduct all necessary investigations in 1 place to initiate rapid treatment, including brain and
vascular imaging, heart monitoring, and laboratory tests.
dFor example, a provincial stroke-prevention clinic or community neurology/internal medicine clinic with a stroke-prevention focus.
eMotor weakness may be in 1 body segment (face, arm, or leg), but sensory loss must involve at least 2 contiguous segments (face/arm or
arm/leg) on 1 side of the body to be considered highest risk.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.
Module 2 Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• Standardized priority protocols should be established for all suspected stroke patients to receive treatment as soon as
possible and be admitted to a stroke unit within the first few hours after presenting to an ED
• Hospitals should have ready access to rectal ASA
