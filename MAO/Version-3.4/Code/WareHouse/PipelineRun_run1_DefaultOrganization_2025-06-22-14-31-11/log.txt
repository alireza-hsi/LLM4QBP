**task_prompt**: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack. The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel. Module 3a Implementation Considerations General considerations • All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR • Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up • Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack. |

| **phase_prompt** | task: {task} process text: {refinement_process_text} Check which activities in the process text can be expanded into sub-activities and add these sub-activities to the process text. Please note: 1) Only expand important activities, not all of them. 2) Ensure that the process text remains logical when adding sub-activities. 3) Add appropriate gateways when adding activities. 4) When modifying the process text, note whether the newly added activity is a sequential, exclusive, or concurrent relationship. 5) Only expand activities if it's necessary and do not create overly detailed sub-activities. Here are some examples of expanding activities in process texts into sub-activities. You can refer to them but cannot copy them: 1. 'payment with card/cash' activity with id='activity2' can be expanded to:    sub-activity:'Payment with card' and 'Payment with cash'     activity relations: exclusive 2. 'club interviewid and confimation email' activity with id='activity5' can be expanded to:    sub-activity:'Interview at the club' and 'Send confirmation email'    activity relations: sequential 3. 'Submit the materials' activity with id='activity9' can be expanded to:    sub-activity:'Submit interview materials' and 'Submit examination materials'     activity relations: parallel After extending the activity, number the activity or gateway in addition to the original id. If the sub-activity are exclusive or parallel relationships, you need to add them in the form of gateways when modifying the process text: {format} First output which activities can be extended according to the above format (...... can be expanded to:.......) and then give the modified process text.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Check which activities in the process text can be expanded into sub-activities and add these sub-activities to the process text. Please note:
1) Only expand important activities, not all of them.
2) Ensure that the process text remains logical when adding sub-activities.
3) Add appropriate gateways when adding activities.
4) When modifying the process text, note whether the newly added activity is a sequential, exclusive, or concurrent relationship.
5) Only expand activities if it's necessary and do not create overly detailed sub-activities.
Here are some examples of expanding activities in process texts into sub-activities. You can refer to them but cannot copy them:
1. 'payment with card/cash' activity with id='activity2' can be expanded to:
   sub-activity:'Payment with card' and 'Payment with cash' 
   activity relations: exclusive
2. 'club interviewid and confimation email' activity with id='activity5' can be expanded to:
   sub-activity:'Interview at the club' and 'Send confirmation email'
   activity relations: sequential
3. 'Submit the materials' activity with id='activity9' can be expanded to:
   sub-activity:'Submit interview materials' and 'Submit examination materials' 
   activity relations: parallel
After extending the activity, number the activity or gateway in addition to the original id. If the sub-activity are exclusive or parallel relationships, you need to add them in the form of gateways when modifying the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

First output which activities can be extended according to the above format (...... can be expanded to:.......) and then give the modified process text. Don't say anything else.

Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a

Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

The following activities can be expanded:

1. 'Screen/assess for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon ED presentation; forward results to TIA clinic for follow-up' (id='activity1') can be expanded to:
   - 'Screen/assess for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon ED presentation'

3. 'Mobilize patient early (between 24-48 hours of stroke onset) unless contraindicated; avoid frequent out-of-bed activity within first 24 hours' (id='activity7') can be expanded to:
   - 'Determine if early mobilization is contraindicated'
   - 'Mobilize patient early (between 24-48 hours of stroke onset) if not contraindicated'

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool.

For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Please check whether there are logic problems and format problems of activities and gateways in the process text, such as the reverse of the order of activities, unreasonable design of gateways, and wrong order of activities or branches. For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained.
Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:

  </sequenceGateway>
</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: The parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1' contains branches (such as branch2 and branch3) where the activities are not truly parallel but may have dependencies (e.g., assessment should logically precede management plan formulation, and determining contraindication should precede mobilization). Additionally, the assessment and management plan activities within branch2 are sequential but are placed together in a parallel branch, which is a format error.

Suggested modification: Separate sequential activities within branch2 and branch3 into individual activities outside the parallel gateway, or use nested gateways if parallelism is required after an initial assessment step. For example, move 'Assess stroke patient within 48 hours of admission' outside the parallel gateway, then use the parallel gateway for subsequent activities that can occur simultaneously.

Reason: In a parallel gateway, all branches should represent activities that can occur independently and simultaneously. Sequential activities within a parallel branch violate this principle and may cause confusion in process execution and modeling.

3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

suggestion:
Problem: The parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1' contains branches (such as branch2 and branch3) where the activities are not truly parallel but may have dependencies (e.g., assessment should logically precede management plan formulation, and determining contraindication should precede mobilization). Additionally, the assessment and management plan activities within branch2 are sequential but are placed together in a parallel branch, which is a format error.

Suggested modification: Separate sequential activities within branch2 and branch3 into individual activities outside the parallel gateway, or use nested gateways if parallelism is required after an initial assessment step. For example, move 'Assess stroke patient within 48 hours of admission' outside the parallel gateway, then use the parallel gateway for subsequent activities that can occur simultaneously.

Reason: In a parallel gateway, all branches should represent activities that can occur independently and simultaneously. Sequential activities within a parallel branch violate this principle and may cause confusion in process execution and modeling.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

[You're a process design reviewer. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening

dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke

discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack. The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel. Module 3a Implementation Considerations General considerations • All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR • Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up • Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack. |

| **phase_prompt** | task: {task} process text: {reviewed_process_text} Please check whether there are logic problems and format problems of activities and gateways in the process text, such as the reverse of the order of activities, unreasonable design of gateways, and wrong order of activities or branches. For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway. When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text: {format} Please note: 1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me.  2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else. |

the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency

of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)

venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: The activities 'Assess nutrition status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-1') and 'Assess hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-2') are placed inside a nested parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway2') within a branch of another parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1'). However, these two assessments are both required for every patient and do not require a separate parallel gateway, as they are already within a parallel branch structure. This creates unnecessary complexity and redundancy.

Suggested modification: Remove the nested parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway2') and place both activities sequentially within the same branch (id='branch6') of the outer parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1').

Reason: Both nutrition and hydration assessments are standard, required, and can be performed in parallel or sequentially as part of the same workflow step for each patient. Nesting a parallel gateway within another parallel gateway for only two required assessments adds unnecessary complexity and does not improve process clarity.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

suggestion:
Problem: The activities 'Assess nutrition status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-1') and 'Assess hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-2') are placed inside a nested parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway2') within a branch of another parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1'). However, these two assessments are both required for every patient and do not require a separate parallel gateway, as they are already within a parallel branch structure. This creates unnecessary complexity and redundancy.

Suggested modification: Remove the nested parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway2') and place both activities sequentially within the same branch (id='branch6') of the outer parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1').

Reason: Both nutrition and hydration assessments are standard, required, and can be performed in parallel or sequentially as part of the same workflow step for each patient. Nesting a parallel gateway within another parallel gateway for only two required assessments adds unnecessary complexity and does not improve process clarity.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.

assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Please check whether there are logic problems and format problems of activities and gateways in the process text, such as the reverse of the order of activities, unreasonable design of gateways, and wrong order of activities or branches. For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained.
Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:

    <activity role='Express company' action='end of service' objects='' id='activity7'/>
    <activity role='recipient' action='sign for package' objects='package' id='activity8'/>
  </sequenceGateway>
</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: The activities 'Assess nutrition status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-1') and 'Assess hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-2') are listed sequentially within the same branch of the parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1'), but these two assessments are logically parallel and should be represented as separate branches within the parallel gateway.

Suggested modification: Move 'Assess hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-2') into a new, separate branch under the parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1'), so that both nutrition and hydration assessments are performed in parallel.

Reason: Nutrition and hydration assessments are independent activities that can be performed simultaneously; representing them as sequential within the same branch is a logic error in the process design. Each should be in its own branch under the parallel gateway to accurately reflect parallel execution.

3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

suggestion:
Problem: The activities 'Assess nutrition status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-1') and 'Assess hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-2') are listed sequentially within the same branch of the parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1'), but these two assessments are logically parallel and should be represented as separate branches within the parallel gateway.

Suggested modification: Move 'Assess hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-2') into a new, separate branch under the parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1'), so that both nutrition and hydration assessments are performed in parallel.

Reason: Nutrition and hydration assessments are independent activities that can be performed simultaneously; representing them as sequential within the same branch is a logic error in the process design. Each should be in its own branch under the parallel gateway to accurately reflect parallel execution.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>

The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

[You're a process design reviewer. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack. The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel. Module 3a Implementation Considerations General considerations • All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR • Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up • Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack. |

For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway. When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text: {format} Please note: 1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested.

3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.

venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: The activities 'Assess nutrition status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-1') and 'Assess hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-2') are placed in separate branches of the parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1'), but logically, both assessments should be performed together for every patient, not as parallel alternatives.

Suggested modification: Combine 'Assess nutrition status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-1') and 'Assess hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-2') into a single activity within one branch, or place them sequentially within the same branch of the parallel gateway.

Reason: Both nutrition and hydration assessments are required for all patients within the first 48 hours and are not alternatives or independent parallel tasks. Placing them in separate parallel branches may imply they are performed independently or only one is chosen, which is not consistent with the clinical requirements.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

suggestion:
Problem: The activities 'Assess nutrition status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-1') and 'Assess hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-2') are placed in separate branches of the parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1'), but logically, both assessments should be performed together for every patient, not as parallel alternatives.

Suggested modification: Combine 'Assess nutrition status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-1') and 'Assess hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity12-2') into a single activity within one branch, or place them sequentially within the same branch of the parallel gateway.

Reason: Both nutrition and hydration assessments are required for all patients within the first 48 hours and are not alternatives or independent parallel tasks. Placing them in separate parallel branches may imply they are performed independently or only one is chosen, which is not consistent with the clinical requirements.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>

</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>

  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum

definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool.

For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway. When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text: {format} Please note: 1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested.

Please check whether there are logic problems and format problems of activities and gateways in the process text, such as the reverse of the order of activities, unreasonable design of gateways, and wrong order of activities or branches. For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained.

  </sequenceGateway>
</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', the activity with id='activity12' ("Assess nutrition and hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tools") is immediately followed by an exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway2' within the same branch. However, this structure creates a nested gateway within a parallel branch, which is not recommended in BPMN best practices as it can cause confusion and complicate process execution and readability.

Suggested modification: Move the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway2' outside the parallel gateway, so that the assessment of nutrition and hydration status is performed in parallel, and then, after the parallel gateway, use the exclusive gateway to decide on the referral to a dietitian or continued monitoring.

Reason: Nesting an exclusive gateway directly inside a parallel gateway branch can make the process difficult to follow and may lead to execution ambiguities. Separating the gateways clarifies the process flow and aligns with BPMN modeling best practices.

suggestion:
Problem: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', the activity with id='activity12' ("Assess nutrition and hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tools") is immediately followed by an exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway2' within the same branch. However, this structure creates a nested gateway within a parallel branch, which is not recommended in BPMN best practices as it can cause confusion and complicate process execution and readability.

Suggested modification: Move the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway2' outside the parallel gateway, so that the assessment of nutrition and hydration status is performed in parallel, and then, after the parallel gateway, use the exclusive gateway to decide on the referral to a dietitian or continued monitoring.

Reason: Nesting an exclusive gateway directly inside a parallel gateway branch can make the process difficult to follow and may lead to execution ambiguities. Separating the gateways clarifies the process flow and aligns with BPMN modeling best practices.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

[You're a process design reviewer. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time to get results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.
<end of extra knowledge>
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke
Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Move the activity <activity role='clinical team' action='Provide appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (per Modules 5 and 10), regardless of discharge destination' objects='patient, prevention protocols' id='activity16'/> to be the last activity before the end of the process, after all other activities in both branches of the exclusive gateway.

Reason: According to the extra knowledge provided, the activity related to cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies should be the final step in the process, ensuring that all acute care and assessment activities are completed before secondary prevention is addressed. This sequencing aligns with best practice and ensures clarity in the process flow.

[You're a process design expert. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include process generation, process refinement, process review and so on, guided by team leader.
You model the process of a clinical practice guideline to a clinical pathway.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Advisor's suggestion:
Suggested modification: Move the activity <activity role='clinical team' action='Provide appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (per Modules 5 and 10), regardless of discharge destination' objects='patient, prevention protocols' id='activity16'/> to be the last activity before the end of the process, after all other activities in both branches of the exclusive gateway.

Reason: According to the extra knowledge provided, the activity related to cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies should be the final step in the process, ensuring that all acute care and assessment activities are completed before secondary prevention is addressed. This sequencing aligns with best practice and ensures clarity in the process flow.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time to get results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.
<end of extra knowledge>
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke
Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Move the activity <activity role='clinical team' action='Provide appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (per Modules 5 and 10), regardless of discharge destination' objects='patient, prevention protocols' id='activity16'/> to the very end of the process, immediately before </process>.

Reason: According to the extra knowledge provided, the activity related to cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies should be the last activity after all other process steps are completed and before the process ends. This ensures that secondary prevention is addressed for all patients as a final, comprehensive step, regardless of their care pathway, and aligns with best practice recommendations for process sequencing.

[You're a process design expert. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include process generation, process refinement, process review and so on, guided by team leader.
You model the process of a clinical practice guideline to a clinical pathway.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Reason: According to the extra knowledge provided, the activity related to cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies should be the last activity after all other process steps are completed and before the process ends. This ensures that secondary prevention is addressed for all patients as a final, comprehensive step, regardless of their care pathway, and aligns with best practice recommendations for process sequencing.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time to get results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.
<end of extra knowledge>
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke
Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Move the activity <activity role='clinical team' action='Provide appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (per Modules 5 and 10), regardless of discharge destination' objects='patient, prevention protocols' id='activity16'/> to the very end of the process, immediately before </process>.

Reason: According to the extra knowledge provided, the activity related to cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies should be the last activity after all other process steps are completed and before the end of the process. This ensures that secondary prevention is addressed for all patients as a final, comprehensive step, regardless of their care pathway, and aligns with best practice sequencing.

[You're a process design expert. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include process generation, process refinement, process review and so on, guided by team leader.
You model the process of a clinical practice guideline to a clinical pathway.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Reason: According to the extra knowledge provided, the activity related to cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies should be the last activity after all other process steps are completed and before the end of the process. This ensures that secondary prevention is addressed for all patients as a final, comprehensive step, regardless of their care pathway, and aligns with best practice sequencing.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time to get results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.
<end of extra knowledge>
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke
Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Move the activity <activity role='clinical team' action='Provide appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (per Modules 5 and 10), regardless of discharge destination' objects='patient, prevention protocols' id='activity16'/> to be the last activity in the process, immediately before </process>.

Reason: According to the extra knowledge provided, the activity related to cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies should be performed after all other activities are completed and just before the end of the process. This ensures that all acute care and assessment steps are completed first, aligning with best practice sequencing and process clarity.

[You're a process design expert. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include process generation, process refinement, process review and so on, guided by team leader.
You model the process of a clinical practice guideline to a clinical pathway.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Advisor's suggestion:
Suggested modification: Move the activity <activity role='clinical team' action='Provide appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (per Modules 5 and 10), regardless of discharge destination' objects='patient, prevention protocols' id='activity16'/> to be the last activity in the process, immediately before </process>.

Reason: According to the extra knowledge provided, the activity related to cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies should be performed after all other activities are completed and just before the end of the process. This ensures that all acute care and assessment steps are completed first, aligning with best practice sequencing and process clarity.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time to get results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.
<end of extra knowledge>
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke
Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Move the activity <activity role='clinical team' action='Provide appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (per Modules 5 and 10), regardless of discharge destination' objects='patient, prevention protocols' id='activity16'/> to be the last activity in the process, immediately before the closing </process> tag.

Reason: According to the extra knowledge provided, the activity related to cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies should be performed after all other activities are completed, serving as the final step before the process ends. This ensures that secondary prevention is addressed for all patients, regardless of their care pathway, and aligns with best practice sequencing.

[You're a process design expert. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include process generation, process refinement, process review and so on, guided by team leader.
You model the process of a clinical practice guideline to a clinical pathway.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

[You're a Knowledge Graph Advisor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your job is to review process models and provide actionable suggestions for improvement, one at a time.
You use extra knowledge provided to you to inform your suggestions. Your main responsibilities include giving suggestions and your reasoning to the process design expert.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)
Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke
Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]
