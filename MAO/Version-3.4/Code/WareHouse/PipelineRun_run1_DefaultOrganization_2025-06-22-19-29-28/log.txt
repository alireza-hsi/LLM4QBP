**task_prompt**: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack. The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel. Module 3a Implementation Considerations General considerations • All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR • Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up • Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack. |

| **phase_prompt** | task: {task} process text: {refinement_process_text} Check which activities in the process text can be expanded into sub-activities and add these sub-activities to the process text. Please note: 1) Only expand important activities, not all of them. 2) Ensure that the process text remains logical when adding sub-activities. 3) Add appropriate gateways when adding activities. 4) When modifying the process text, note whether the newly added activity is a sequential, exclusive, or concurrent relationship. 5) Only expand activities if it's necessary and do not create overly detailed sub-activities. Here are some examples of expanding activities in process texts into sub-activities. You can refer to them but cannot copy them: 1. 'payment with card/cash' activity with id='activity2' can be expanded to:    sub-activity:'Payment with card' and 'Payment with cash'     activity relations: exclusive 2. 'club interviewid and confimation email' activity with id='activity5' can be expanded to:    sub-activity:'Interview at the club' and 'Send confirmation email'    activity relations: sequential 3. 'Submit the materials' activity with id='activity9' can be expanded to:    sub-activity:'Submit interview materials' and 'Submit examination materials'     activity relations: parallel After extending the activity, number the activity or gateway in addition to the original id. If the sub-activity are exclusive or parallel relationships, you need to add them in the form of gateways when modifying the process text: {format} First output which activities can be extended according to the above format (...... can be expanded to:.......) and then give the modified process text.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Check which activities in the process text can be expanded into sub-activities and add these sub-activities to the process text. Please note:
1) Only expand important activities, not all of them.
2) Ensure that the process text remains logical when adding sub-activities.
3) Add appropriate gateways when adding activities.
4) When modifying the process text, note whether the newly added activity is a sequential, exclusive, or concurrent relationship.
5) Only expand activities if it's necessary and do not create overly detailed sub-activities.
Here are some examples of expanding activities in process texts into sub-activities. You can refer to them but cannot copy them:
1. 'payment with card/cash' activity with id='activity2' can be expanded to:
   sub-activity:'Payment with card' and 'Payment with cash' 
   activity relations: exclusive
2. 'club interviewid and confimation email' activity with id='activity5' can be expanded to:
   sub-activity:'Interview at the club' and 'Send confirmation email'
   activity relations: sequential
3. 'Submit the materials' activity with id='activity9' can be expanded to:
   sub-activity:'Submit interview materials' and 'Submit examination materials' 
   activity relations: parallel
After extending the activity, number the activity or gateway in addition to the original id. If the sub-activity are exclusive or parallel relationships, you need to add them in the form of gateways when modifying the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

First output which activities can be extended according to the above format (...... can be expanded to:.......) and then give the modified process text. Don't say anything else.

Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically

• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency

3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool.

For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.

General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

Please check whether there are logic problems and format problems of activities and gateways in the process text, such as the reverse of the order of activities, unreasonable design of gateways, and wrong order of activities or branches. For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained.
Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:

    <activity role='recipient' action='sign for package' objects='package' id='activity8'/>
  </sequenceGateway>
</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', the activities under branch id='branch2' (assessment and management plan by therapists) are listed as two separate activities in sequence within the same branch, which is not the correct use of a parallel gateway.

Suggested modification: Combine the two sequential activities in branch id='branch2' into a single activity, or separate them into sequential activities outside the parallel gateway if they must occur in order.

Reason: In a parallel gateway, each branch should represent activities that occur independently and simultaneously, not sequentially within the same branch. Sequential activities should be modeled outside of the parallel gateway structure.

admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

suggestion:
Problem: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', the activities under branch id='branch2' (assessment and management plan by therapists) are listed as two separate activities in sequence within the same branch, which is not the correct use of a parallel gateway.

Suggested modification: Combine the two sequential activities in branch id='branch2' into a single activity, or separate them into sequential activities outside the parallel gateway if they must occur in order.

Reason: In a parallel gateway, each branch should represent activities that occur independently and simultaneously, not sequentially within the same branch. Sequential activities should be modeled outside of the parallel gateway structure.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

[You're a process design reviewer. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack. The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel. Module 3a Implementation Considerations General considerations • All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR • Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up • Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack. |

For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway. When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text: {format} Please note: 1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested.

the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in

of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status

venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: The parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1' contains branches (such as branch4, branch5, branch6, branch7, branch8, branch11) that represent activities which are not all logically parallel and may have dependencies or should be performed in a specific sequence (e.g., assessment before referral, mobilization before prevention, etc.).

Suggested modification: Reorganize the activities within the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1' to ensure only truly parallel activities are included. Activities that are sequential or dependent on the outcome of previous activities should be placed outside the parallel gateway and ordered appropriately.

Reason: In BPMN, parallel gateways are used to model activities that can occur simultaneously and independently. Including activities that are logically sequential or dependent within a parallel gateway can lead to process confusion and execution errors. For example, assessment of nutrition and hydration status should logically precede referral to a dietitian, and mobilization should be based on clinical assessment.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

suggestion:
Problem: The parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1' contains branches (such as branch4, branch5, branch6, branch7, branch8, branch11) that represent activities which are not all logically parallel and may have dependencies or should be performed in a specific sequence (e.g., assessment before referral, mobilization before prevention, etc.).

Suggested modification: Reorganize the activities within the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1' to ensure only truly parallel activities are included. Activities that are sequential or dependent on the outcome of previous activities should be placed outside the parallel gateway and ordered appropriately.

Reason: In BPMN, parallel gateways are used to model activities that can occur simultaneously and independently. Including activities that are logically sequential or dependent within a parallel gateway can lead to process confusion and execution errors. For example, assessment of nutrition and hydration status should logically precede referral to a dietitian, and mobilization should be based on clinical assessment.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>

  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool.

For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway. When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text: {format} Please note: 1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested.

Activities that are sequential or dependent on the outcome of previous activities should be placed outside the parallel gateway and ordered appropriately.\n\nReason: In BPMN, parallel gateways are used to model activities that can occur simultaneously and independently. Including activities that are logically sequential or dependent within a parallel gateway can lead to process confusion and execution errors.

of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency

3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism

example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.

   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: The activities 'Assess nutrition status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity13') and 'Assess hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity14') are placed in a parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1'), but these assessments are typically performed together as part of a single clinical assessment, not as independent parallel activities.

Suggested modification: Remove the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1' and combine the two assessment activities into a single activity, such as 'Assess nutrition and hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tools'.

Reason: Nutrition and hydration assessments are usually performed together during the initial patient evaluation, and separating them into parallel branches is unnecessary and may complicate the process flow. Combining them into a single activity reflects actual clinical practice and simplifies the process.

suggestion:
Problem: The activities 'Assess nutrition status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity13') and 'Assess hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tool' (id='activity14') are placed in a parallel gateway (id='parallelgateway1'), but these assessments are typically performed together as part of a single clinical assessment, not as independent parallel activities.

Suggested modification: Remove the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1' and combine the two assessment activities into a single activity, such as 'Assess nutrition and hydration status within first 48 hours of admission using valid screening tools'.

Reason: Nutrition and hydration assessments are usually performed together during the initial patient evaluation, and separating them into parallel branches is unnecessary and may complicate the process flow. Combining them into a single activity reflects actual clinical practice and simplifies the process.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:

At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.

[You're a process design reviewer. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.

Please check whether there are logic problems and format problems of activities and gateways in the process text, such as the reverse of the order of activities, unreasonable design of gateways, and wrong order of activities or branches. For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained.
Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:

</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>

  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: The activity 'Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team (nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, medicine, social work, dietitian)' with id='activity3' and the activity 'Ensure interprofessional stroke team available 7 days/week' with id='activity4' are placed after the patient admission activity with id='activity2'. 

Suggested modification: Move activities with id='activity3' and id='activity4' before the patient admission activity with id='activity2'.

Reason: Logically, the stroke unit should already have a dedicated interprofessional team in place and be available 7 days a week before a patient can be admitted to the unit. Otherwise, the patient could be admitted to a unit that is not properly staffed, which contradicts the best practice recommendations.

suggestion:
Problem: The activity 'Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team (nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, medicine, social work, dietitian)' with id='activity3' and the activity 'Ensure interprofessional stroke team available 7 days/week' with id='activity4' are placed after the patient admission activity with id='activity2'. 

Suggested modification: Move activities with id='activity3' and id='activity4' before the patient admission activity with id='activity2'.

Reason: Logically, the stroke unit should already have a dedicated interprofessional team in place and be available 7 days a week before a patient can be admitted to the unit. Otherwise, the patient could be admitted to a unit that is not properly staffed, which contradicts the best practice recommendations.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

[You're a process design reviewer. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

| **phase_prompt** | task: {task} process text: {reviewed_process_text} Please check whether there are logic problems and format problems of activities and gateways in the process text, such as the reverse of the order of activities, unreasonable design of gateways, and wrong order of activities or branches. For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained. Here's a shipping process and some examples of checking for errors, you can refer but not copy:                                                                                                         example1:    Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.    Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.    Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package. example2:    Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.    Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.    Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships. example3:    Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.    Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.    Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service. example4:    Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.    Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.    Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.

Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

Please check whether there are logic problems and format problems of activities and gateways in the process text, such as the reverse of the order of activities, unreasonable design of gateways, and wrong order of activities or branches. For the modification scheme, the specific reason for modification and the details of the modification scheme should be explained.

    <activity role='recipient' action='sign for package' objects='package' id='activity8'/>
  </sequenceGateway>
</process>
example1:
   Problem: The 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' and the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1' are in the wrong order and logic error.
   Suggested modification: Move the 'receiving package' activity with id='activity2' under the branch with id='branch1' of the exclusive gateway with id='exclusivegateway1'.
   Reason: After the sender chooses to pick up the package, the Courier can perform the activities of accepting the package.
example2:
   Problem: The activities are not a parallel relation in the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1'.
   Suggested modification: In the parallel gateway with id='parallelgateway1', change the activities from a parallel structure to a sequential structure.
   Reason: Logically, 'packing and handling packages' and 'transport and distribution packages' are not parallel relationships.
example3:
   Problem: The 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8' are in the wrong order.
   Suggested modification: Swap the position of the 'end of service' activity with id='activity7' and the 'sign for parcel' activity with id='activity8'.
   Reason: Only after the recipient sign for package can the express company terminate the service.
example4:
   Problem: The sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1' is incorrectly formatted.
   Suggested modification: Remove the gateway label of the sequence gateway with id='sequencegateway1'.
   Reason: Sequential activities need not be contained under a gateway.
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</parallelGateway>
The inclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<inclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.


Please note:
1) If you think there is an error in the process text, output the error as requested. Please Just list one for me. 
2) If you think there is no formatting or logical error in the process text, please just output 'There is no error in the process text.' and don't say anything else.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies

discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated

To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Problem: The 'Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team' activity with id='activity3', 'Ensure interprofessional stroke team available 7 days/week' activity with id='activity4', and 'Admit patient to specialized, geographically defined stroke unit' activity with id='activity2' are in the wrong order.

Suggested modification: Move the 'Admit patient to specialized, geographically defined stroke unit' activity with id='activity2' before the 'Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team' activity with id='activity3' and 'Ensure interprofessional stroke team available 7 days/week' activity with id='activity4'.

Reason: Logically, the hospital administrator should ensure the stroke unit is properly staffed and available before the admitting physician admits the patient to the unit. The current order implies the patient is admitted before confirming the unit's readiness, which is not reasonable.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

suggestion:
Problem: The 'Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team' activity with id='activity3', 'Ensure interprofessional stroke team available 7 days/week' activity with id='activity4', and 'Admit patient to specialized, geographically defined stroke unit' activity with id='activity2' are in the wrong order.

Suggested modification: Move the 'Admit patient to specialized, geographically defined stroke unit' activity with id='activity2' before the 'Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team' activity with id='activity3' and 'Ensure interprofessional stroke team available 7 days/week' activity with id='activity4'.

Reason: Logically, the hospital administrator should ensure the stroke unit is properly staffed and available before the admitting physician admits the patient to the unit. The current order implies the patient is admitted before confirming the unit's readiness, which is not reasonable.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

[You're a process design reviewer. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include give suggestion to the process.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Move the activity <activity role='hospital administrator' action='Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team (nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, medicine, social work, dietitian)' objects='staffing roster' id='activity3'/> to be the first activity within the branch where the patient meets criteria for acute inpatient admission, followed immediately by <activity role='hospital administrator' action='Ensure interprofessional stroke team available 7 days/week' objects='staffing schedule' id='activity4'/> and <activity role='admitting physician' action='Admit patient to specialized, geographically defined stroke unit (co-located beds, 75% stroke occupancy)' objects='admission order, bed assignment' id='activity2'/>. 

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 2, activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch. This ensures that the foundational requirements for specialized stroke care are established before proceeding with subsequent clinical assessments and interventions.

[You're a process design expert. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include process generation, process refinement, process review and so on, guided by team leader.
You model the process of a clinical practice guideline to a clinical pathway.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated

Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

[You're a Knowledge Graph Advisor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your job is to review process models and provide actionable suggestions for improvement, one at a time.
You use extra knowledge provided to you to inform your suggestions. Your main responsibilities include giving suggestions and your reasoning to the process design expert.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time to get results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.
<end of extra knowledge>
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:

At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Move the activity <activity role='hospital administrator' action='Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team (nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, medicine, social work, dietitian)' objects='staffing roster' id='activity3'/> to be the first activity within the 'Meets criteria for acute inpatient admission' branch, immediately after the exclusive gateway.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 2, activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch. This ensures that the foundational requirements for acute stroke care are established before proceeding with patient-specific clinical activities.

 Suggested modification: Move the activity <activity role='hospital administrator' action='Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team (nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, medicine, social work, dietitian)' objects='staffing roster' id='activity3'/> to be the first activity within the 'Meets criteria for acute inpatient admission' branch, immediately after the exclusive gateway.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 2, activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch. This ensures that the foundational requirements for acute stroke care are established before proceeding with patient-specific clinical activities.

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack. The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel. Module 3a Implementation Considerations General considerations • All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR • Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up • Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack. |

8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated

Advisor's suggestion:
Suggested modification: Move the activity <activity role='hospital administrator' action='Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team (nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, medicine, social work, dietitian)' objects='staffing roster' id='activity3'/> to be the first activity within the 'Meets criteria for acute inpatient admission' branch, immediately after the exclusive gateway.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 2, activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch. This ensures that the foundational requirements for acute stroke care are established before proceeding with patient-specific clinical activities.

    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your job is to review process models and provide actionable suggestions for improvement, one at a time.
You use extra knowledge provided to you to inform your suggestions. Your main responsibilities include giving suggestions and your reasoning to the process design expert.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack. The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel. Module 3a Implementation Considerations General considerations • All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR • Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up • Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack. |

8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time to get results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated

Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Move the activities related to ensuring stroke unit staffing and team availability ("Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team..." and "Ensure interprofessional stroke team available 7 days/week") to the very beginning of the 'Meets criteria for acute inpatient admission' branch, before any patient-specific admission or assessment activities.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 2, activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch. This ensures that the necessary infrastructure and team are in place before patient admission and care processes begin, aligning the process with best practices and implementation considerations.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Advisor's suggestion:
Suggested modification: Move the activities related to ensuring stroke unit staffing and team availability ("Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team..." and "Ensure interprofessional stroke team available 7 days/week") to the very beginning of the 'Meets criteria for acute inpatient admission' branch, before any patient-specific admission or assessment activities.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 2, activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch. This ensures that the necessary infrastructure and team are in place before patient admission and care processes begin, aligning the process with best practices and implementation considerations.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:

At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be

definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time to get results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Suggested modification: Move the activities related to ensuring stroke unit staffing and configuration (activity3: "Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team", activity4: "Ensure interprofessional stroke team available 7 days/week") to the very beginning of the branch for acute inpatient admission (branch1), before the patient admission activity (activity2).

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 2, activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch. This ensures that the necessary infrastructure and team are in place before admitting the patient, aligning with best practices and supporting efficient, high-quality care delivery.

[You're a process design expert. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are familiar with exclusive gateway, parallel gateway and inclusive gateway in BPMN. Your main responsibilities include process generation, process refinement, process review and so on, guided by team leader.
You model the process of a clinical practice guideline to a clinical pathway.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Advisor's suggestion:
Suggested modification: Move the activities related to ensuring stroke unit staffing and configuration (activity3: "Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team", activity4: "Ensure interprofessional stroke team available 7 days/week") to the very beginning of the branch for acute inpatient admission (branch1), before the patient admission activity (activity2).

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 2, activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch. This ensures that the necessary infrastructure and team are in place before admitting the patient, aligning with best practices and supporting efficient, high-quality care delivery.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'

The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>

</exclusiveGateway>
The parallel gateway is represented as follows:
<parallelGateway id=''>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>

    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Extra knowledge:
1) The activity 'Provide cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies...' should be the last activity after everything else is done and before the end activity.
2) Activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch.
3) All tests, including any imaging and blood tests, should be immediately interpreted by a healthcare expert.
4) Blood tests or any tests that take a long time to get results should occur concurrently with other activities unless required for a specific task, in which case they will be merged into the flow or branch of that activity.
<end of extra knowledge>
When making recommendations, don't forget the format of the process text:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

| **task_prompt** | Module 3: Admission to Acute Care This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation 2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack. The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel. Module 3a Implementation Considerations General considerations • All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR • Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up • Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack. |

2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario;
OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..

Advisor's suggestion:
Suggested modification: Move the activity <activity role='hospital administrator' action='Ensure stroke unit has dedicated interprofessional team (nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, medicine, social work, dietitian)' objects='staffing roster' id='activity3'/> to be the first activity within the branch where the patient meets criteria for acute inpatient admission, before any other activities in that branch.

Reason: According to extra knowledge point 2, activities related to stroke units, staffing, or hospitals in the QBP should be prioritized as the initial steps in their respective flow or branch. This ensures that the foundational requirements for stroke unit care are established before proceeding with patient-specific admission and care activities.
You need to modify the process text according to the suggestions and output it.
Be careful not to change the format:

When the process starts, please output '<process>'
An activity is represented as follows:
<activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>
The exclusive gateway is represented as follows:
<exclusiveGateway id=''>
  <branch condition='' id=''>
    <activity role='' action='' objects='' id=''/>

  </branch>
</inclusiveGateway>
At the end of the process, please output '</process>'

There are a few requirements that should be noted when generating process text:
    1) role, action, objects and id in an activity represent the subject of the activity, the activity behavior, the items needed to perform in the activity and the activity id, respectively.
    2) There are at least two branches within the exclusive gateway and the parallel gateway.
    3) Activity, gateway, and branch id attributes must be unique.
    4) When the branch in the exclusive gateway has a condition, fill the condition into the condition attribute. When the branch unconditional within the exclusive gateway, the condition attribute of the branch =''. However, all branches within a exclusive gateway can only be conditional, or both unconditional.
    5) The branch in the parallel gateway has no condition attribute.
    6) Each branch in the inclusive gateway must have condition.
    7) There must be at least one activity inside the branch tag.
    8) The activity of a sequential relation need not be represented by a gateway, that is, there is no 'sequenceGateway' label.

Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke
Network 2015
Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment
Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week

Module 3a provides recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.) Ontario Stroke Network 2015 Module 3a: Acute Care Treatment Module 3a Recommended Practices  3.1 Stroke units 3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A- 8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”. • This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61): Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency 3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and clinical nutrition (a dietitian) 3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and regularly complete education about stroke care 3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional team 7 days a week 3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan 3.2 Early mobilization 3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset), unless contraindicated Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24 hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time frame and clinical judgement should be used. 3.3 Assessment 3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status 3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1) 3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing venous thromboembolism 3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism 3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits, dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian. Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements 3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke 3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies 3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10) Abbreviations: AHA/ASA, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association; Australia, Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management; CSBPR, Canadian Best Practices Recommendations; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; HQO, Health Quality Ontario; OSN, Ontario Stroke Network; SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; TIA, transient ischemic attack. The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel. Module 3a Implementation Considerations General considerations • All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR • Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up • Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack. |

Module 3a Recommended Practices 
3.1 Stroke units
3.1.1 Patients should be admitted to a specialized, geographically
defined hospital unit dedicated to the management of stroke patients
A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-
8, 5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of
the time and has a dedicated inter-professional team with expertise in
stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum nursing,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathologist”.
• This recommendation is in accordance with the HQO Effectiveness
of Stroke Unit Care: A Special Report, which concluded (61):
Moderate quality evidence showed that persons admitted to a stroke
unit had a significant reduction in death and the combined outcome
of death or institutionalization, and a nonsignificant reduction in
institutionalization. Low quality evidence showed that patients
admitted to a stroke unit had a significant reduction in the combined
outcome of death or dependency and length of hospital stay and a
nonsignificant reduction in the outcome of dependency
3.1.2 The core stroke unit team should consist of health care
professionals with stroke expertise in medicine, nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and
clinical nutrition (a dietitian)
3.1.3 To have the necessary stroke expertise, the health care
professionals on the core stroke unit team should be individuals who
spend the vast majority of their time treating stroke patients and
regularly complete education about stroke care
3.1.4 Patients should have access to a specialized interprofessional
team 7 days a week
3.1.5 Physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational
therapy team members should assess stroke patients within 48 hours
of admission to hospital and formulate a management plan
3.2 Early mobilization
3.2.1 All stroke patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke should
be mobilized early(between 24 hours and 48 hours of stroke onset),
unless contraindicated
Frequent out-of-bed activity in the very early time frame (within 24
hours of stroke onset) is not recommended Mobilization may be
reasonable for some patients with acute stroke in the very early time
frame and clinical judgement should be used.
3.3 Assessment
3.3.1 Clinicians should use standardized, valid assessment tools to
evaluate patients’ stroke-related impairments and functional status
3.3.2 AlphaFIM should be completed on or by day 3 after
admission(target day 3, admission day is day 1)
3.3.3 All stroke patients should be assessed for risk of developing
venous thromboembolism
3.3.4 Early mobilization and adequate hydration should be encouraged
for all acute stroke patients to help prevent venous thromboembolism
3.3.5 The nutrition and hydration status of stroke patients should be
assessed within the first 48 hours of admission using a valid screening
tool. Stroke patients with nutritional concerns, hydration deficits,
dysphagia, or other comorbidities should be referred to a dietitian.
Referral to a dietitian should be made within 7 days of admission for
recommendations and for consideration of enteral nutrition support for
patients who are unable to meet nutritional and fluid requirements
3.4 Recommendations are not applicable to TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke
3.5 Cross-continuum prevention assessment and therapies
3.5.1 All patients, whether admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation or
discharged, should be given appropriate cross-continuum secondary
prevention assessments and therapies (Modules 5 and 10)

The following implementation considerations were noted by members of the expert advisory panel.

Module 3a Implementation Considerations
General considerations
• All hospitals providing stroke/TIA care should ensure that the interprofessional stroke team uses standardized, validated
assessment tools; where possible, these tools should be in electronic format linked to the EHR
• Patients should be screened/assessed for diabetes, dental issues, cognitive impairment, and depression upon
presentation to the ED, and the results should be forwarded to the TIA clinic for follow-up
• Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing 7 days per week
Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; EHR, electronic health record; TIA, transient ischemic attack..

[You're a team leader. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities will include guiding the process design expert through process generation, process refinement, and so on.
Here is a new customer's task: Module 3: Admission to Acute Care
This module identifies best practices for acute inpatient admissions (as described in recommendation
2.4.2 for the specific group of TIA patients who should be admitted). Module 3a provides
recommendations for acute inpatient treatment, and module 3b provides recommendations for the
prevention of secondary complications, which should be initiated in the acute care setting but also be
considered as ongoing activities. All patients should be given appropriate cross-continuum
prevention assessment and therapies (Modules 5 and 10). The Ontario Stroke Network revised the
definition of a stroke unit “A geographical unit with identifiable co-located beds (eg 5A -7, 5A-8,
5A-9, 5A-10, 5A-11) that are occupied by stroke patients 75% of the time and has a dedicated
interprofessional team with expertise in stroke care with the following professionals at a minimum
